Materials for Preparing RFTM: 
- 600 mL beaker 
- Stir bar 
- Foil or masking tape
- Autoclavable screw cap bottles
- FTM powder
- NaCl
- DI water
- chloramphenicol

I. Preparing the RFTM
1. In a 600 mL beaker with a stir bar, combine 14.6 g FTM powder, 10 g NaCl, and 485 mL distilled water
2. Cover the flask with foil, and set heat to 55°C with stirring power at 300-400 rpm until near boiling
3. Allow to cool briefly before adding chloramphenicol (antibiotic) with stirring, this is now your RFTM
4. Fill (125 mL - 500 mL) autoclavable screw capped bottles to 75% capacity for room for heated RFTM, keep bottle caps loose for venting
5. Autoclave RFTM at 121°C for 20 minutes
6. Allow RFTM to cool in a sterile environment, once they have cooled to room temp, close the bottle caps tightly
7. Wrap RFTM in foil or tape to keep in the dark in 4°C fridge (fridge storage allows storage for a year)

Materials needed for RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues
- RFTM
- 1.5 mL tubes
- Dissecting scissors
- Nystatin suspension
- Oysters 

II. RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues

8. In the biosafety cabinet, aliquot 1 mL of RFTM into labeled 1.5 mL tubes; tubes are labeled by tissue types, such as mantle, gills, heart, and rectum
9. Gently add 2-4 drops of nystatin suspension to inhibit fungus growth
10. Obtain two Chebooktook Oysters (Canada) and two Beavertail Oysters (Rhode Island)
11. Under the biosafety cabinet, excise small pieces (3-5 mm) of each oyster's mantle, gill, and heart and inoculate each tissue into each respective 1.5 mL tube
12. Cap tubes loosely, and incubate for 7 days in the dark at 27° (20°C to 30°C is effective)

Materials needed for RFTM assay analysis:
- Lugol's iodine
- DI water
- Sterile probe or tweezers
- Microscope slides
- Microscope coverslips
III. RFTM assay analysis
13. Create 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution
14. Add a small pool of 30 % (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to labeled microscope slides; slides are labeled by tissue types, such as mantle, gills, heart, and rectum
15. With a sterile probe or tweezers, tease each tissue in the iodine solution apart, add another drop of 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution if needed, and mount a coverslip over the stained tissue
16. Examine under microscope for spherical, blue-black *Perkinsus* cells with diameters of 10-100 um
17. Determine, count, and note which oysters have *Perkinsus* present
