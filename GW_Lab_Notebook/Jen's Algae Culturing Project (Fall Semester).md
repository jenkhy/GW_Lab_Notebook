Objective: Culture Algae in slants to practice culturing Perkinsus in slants 
Question: What is the best concentration of F/2 required to yield the most efficient algae growth?

Materials:
- 2 plates for each algal species (there are 3 species, so 6 plates total)
- 3 tubes for each algal species (there are 3 species, so 9 tubes toatl)
11/20/2024
- 2% agar solution was made 
	- 193 mL of 25psu saltwater 
	- 193 uL of F/2 (1 mL/L concentration)
	- 3.86 g agar (2% concentration)
	- Heated at 55°C at 300-400 rpm
- 63 mL of 2% agar solution were separated into seven tubes (each tube contained 7 ml of the 2% agar solution)
- The remaining 120 mL was kept in a flask
- The tubes filled with 2% agar solution and the flask containing 120 mL of 2% agar solution were autoclaved at liquid setting for one hour 
- Tubes and Plates were placed into 4°C fridge overnight to prevent unwanted bacterial growth

11/21/2024
- Streaked agar plates with algae (2 plates for each algal species)
- Placed agar plates into 30°C incubator to incubate for four days 

11/22/2024
- Oysters from Whole foods bought on 11/21/2024 were placed in 11psu saltwater
- Oysters will be used starting January to 
	- Cotuit Oyster (Cotuit Bay, Massachusetts, USA)
	- Chebooktook Oyster(Bouctouche Bay, New Brunswick, Canada)
	- Beavertail Oyster (East Passage Narragansett Bay, RI, USA)
	- Atlantic Blue Point Oyster (Westport and Norwalk Isles, CT, USA)
