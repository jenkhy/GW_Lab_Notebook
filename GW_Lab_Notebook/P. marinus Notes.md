## Perkinsus marinus
**The life stages of P. marinus**
1. Zoospore
	- Motile, has two flagella for it to move around in the water, enters the oyster
2. Trophozoite
	- Becomes motile now that is in the oyster's hemocytes, causes tissue damage
3. Prezoosporangium
	- Protects itself when the oyster dies (the oyster's hemocytes were its home) or when the environment becomes harsh by thickening its cell wall, accumulation of carbs and lipids
	- This stage is also what is seen when the perkinsus cells are in RFTM media
4. Zoosporangium
	- Can release zoospores that will enter more oysters
- Hypnospore
	- when the trophozoite is under stress, such as when it is inoculated in RFTM, it enlarges the cell as the cell membrane is strengthened and the vacuole enlarges


**Optimum living environments** 
- The optimum salinity for P. marinus to thrive is 25-30 ppt

**Infectivity of P. marinus**
- P. marinus can exist in epizootic (sudden high intensity infections within oysters) infections or enzootic infections (consistent low intensity infections within oysters)
- Intensity of P. marinus infections can range from low - low infections that stay for years and only cause slight effects to growth and reproduction, to high - high infections that cause death

**Environmental Factors affecting *Perkinsus* growth**
- High temperature and high salinity affect *Perkinsus* growth when the *Perkinsus* cells are in these two stages:
	- it enlarges the cells by increasing the development of hypnospore (when trophozoites are under stress, like RFTM, trophozoites will enlarge into hypnospores)
	- it enlarges the cells in the trophozoite stage, and increases the trophozoite's metabolic activities
- High salinity increases the infectivity of perkinsus within the oyster host not because of increased infections from the water column (In Sarah's study, the water was changed constantly ruling out that the high intensity of infection was due to reproduction within the oyster)

Season of Perkinsus
- Perkinsus is most prevalent during May through October

## Perkinsus culturing 
- Optimum incubation temperature: 28Â°C
- The optimal seeding density of Perkinsus cultures: 10^4 to 10^5 cells
- The growth rate of Perkinsus increases with inoculation size 
- Tissue-culture treated flask = cells adhere to the flask
