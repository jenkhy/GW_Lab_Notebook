## Perkinsus marinus
**The life stages of P. marinus**
1. Zoospore
	- Motile, flagellated, enters the oyster
2. Trophozoite
	- Becomes motile now that is in the oyster's hemocytes, causes tissue damage
3. Prezoosporangium
	- Protects itself when the oyster dies (the oyster's hemocytes were its home) or when the environment becomes harsh by thickening its cell wall, accumulation of carbs and lipids
	- This stage is also what is seen when the perkinsus cells are in RFTM media
4. Zoosporangium
	- Can release zoospores that will enter more oysters

**Optimum living environments** 
- The optimum salinity for P. marinus to thrive is 25-30 ppt


## Perkinsus culturing 
- Optimum incubation temperature: 28Â°C
- The optimal seeding density of Perkinsus cultures: 10^4 to 10^5 cells
- The growth rate of Perkinsus increases with inoculation size 
- Tissue-culture treated flask = cells adhere to the flask
