	- add 1.29 mL of F/2 to each of the carboys 

08/07/2024
- plans:
	- there is currently about 125 mL of isochrysis 1 stock and about 50 mL of isochrysis 2 stock
		- move 50 mL of iso 1 to iso 2 because iso 2 is very very light in color while iso 1 is much darker

08/08/2024
- plans: 
	- make concentrated tetraselmis 
		- add 100 mL of 28 psu saltwater to tetraselmis 2 stock (there is currently less than 50 mL after using some for outreach yesterday)

	- adding more F/2 to each of the carboys:
		- yes add 96 uL to the isochrysis carboy, which currently has about 7.5 L of algae 
		- yes add 65 uL to the chaetoceros carboy, which currently has about 5 L of algae 
		- add 65 uL to the tetraselmis carboy, which currently has about 5 L of algae
	- adding more F/2 to the stock cultures 
		- add 39 uL to the tetraselmis 1 stock, which currently has about 100 mL of algae 
		- add 39 uL to the isochrysis 1 stock and 50 mL 28 psu, which currently has about 100 mL of algae
		- add 39 uL to the isochrysis 2 stock and 50 mL 28 psu, which currently has about 100 mL of algae 
		- add 39 uL to the chaetoceros 1 stock, which currently has about 150 mL of algae 
		- nothing to chaetoceros 2 because it is very dark already
	- materials needed: 
		- all stock cultures 
		- F/2 media 
		- pipette tips 
		- pipette
		- 28 psu saltwater (needs to be UV'd)

08/09/2024
- plans: 
	- add more 26 uL of F/2 to each of the concentrated stocks of tetraselmis, isochrysis, and chaetoceros
	- add 65 uL more F/2 to the tetraselmis carboy

08/12/2024
- progress: 
	- Last week on 8/8/24 after adding 39 uL to each of the stock cultures except for chaetoceros 2 because it was already very dark, all of the stock cultures except for chaetoceros 2 were put under the LED growlight
	- Tetraselmis chuii 1 crashed 
	- Tetraselmis 2 is still good but could crash soon, so add more 25-28 psu saltwater to it
	- Isochrysis 1 and 2 are good 
	- Chaetoceros 1 crashed 
	- Chaetoceros 2 is good 
	- Putting the algae under the growlight too long (four days) is too extreme and causes them to crash
- plans: 
	- decide how to make a tubing system for taking algae out of carboys
	- autoclave more saltwater 
	- put chaetoceros 1 (crashed) to waste 
	- split chaetoceros 2 into two flasks to make a new chaetoceros 1 and 2
	- put tetraselmis 1 to waste
	- split tetraselmis 2 into two flasks to make a new tetraselmis 1 and 2
	- add more F/2 to outreach flasks
	- add more 20 psu saltwater and F/2 to the 1000 mL chaetoceros (will be used for outreach), there is about 100 mL of it rn
	- add more 25-28 psu saltwater and F/2 to the 1000 mL isochrysis, there is about 150 mL of it rn
	- add 258 uL of F/2 to each of the outreach flasks 
	- add enough saltwater so there is 600 mL in each of the 1000 mL flasks
	- add 200 mL of 20 psu saltwater to the chaetoceros carboy, there is currently about 5 L, add 645 uL F/2 into carboy
	- add 200 mL of 28 psu saltwater to the tetraselmis carboy, there is currently about 5 L, 
	- add 645 uL F/2 into carboy
notes:
- if iso in the 1000 ml flask crashes its bc i put the autoclaved water in too early, it killed the algae
- did NOT add saltwater to the tetraselmis yet because the 28 psu saltwater is too hot still and dont want to risk killing algae 

08/13/2024
- progress: 
	- isochrysis in the 1000 mL flask crashed due to too high temperature
	- added 200 uL F/2 to the 1000 mL flask of chaetoceros (currently about 600 mL)
	- added 200 mL saltwater to each outreach flask (now 500 mL each) and added 26 uL F/2 to each 
- plans:
	- take 200 mL out of each carboy and add 258 uL of F/2 into each 200 mL
	- will place the outreach flasks in front of growlight

08/14/2024
- plans: 
	- add 26 uL to stock cultures tetraselmis 1 and chaetoceros 1, the ones that failed, see if they can succeed in a few days, if not, dispose them as waste

	- pour isochrysis galbana crashed 1000 mL flask into waste 
	- add enough saltwater to all the carboys so there is about 10 L
		- currently about 8 L in iso carboy 
		- currently about 6 L in chaeto carboy 
		- currently about 5 L in tetra carboy 
	- autoclave more saltwater to use for monday
