General steps for Perkinsus culturing: 
1. Make Perkinsus culturing media
2. Homogenize oyster tissue
3. Inoculate homogenized oyster tissue into Perkinsus culturing media 

Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol, if not autoclaved already:
- Two 1000 mL autoclavable glass bottles or larger 
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 1000 mL filtration flask 
- Filtration flask tubing

## Making 1 L of Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM):

### Materials:
- DI water
- Instant Ocean 
- DME
- Ham's F12
- L-glutamine
- Glycine betaine
- Glucose
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Weigh paper/Weigh boat
- Spatula
- Two 1000 mL glass screw cap bottles or larger
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 0.22 um filter paper
- 1000 mL filtration flask
- Vacuum
- Large filtration flask tubing
- Tape
- Sharpie

### Protocol:
1. Make 16 g/L saltwater with instant ocean by adding 16 g of instant ocean to 1000 mL of DI water in 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle 
	- The standard salinity based on existing protocols uses 16 g/L saltwater, for my experiment I will use three salinities:
		- low (5-10 ppt)
		- medium (10-15 ppt)
		- high (20-25 ppt)
2. To the 16 g/L saltwater in the 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle, add:
	- 4.2 g/L DME
	- 5.4 g/L Ham's F12
	- 0.15 g/L L-glutamine
	- 0.015 g/L Glycine betaine 
	- 0.5 g/L glucose
	- 0.65 g/L Sodium bicarbonate
3. This is now your PCM
4. Set up vacuum filtration apparatus in the BSC by spraying each of the following with ethanol before bringing into BSC
	1. 1000 mL filtration flask
	2. 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle of PCM
	3. Empty 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle 
	4. Large filtration flask tubing
	5. Glass filter funnel
	6. Filter base
	7. Clamp
	8. Box of 0.22 um filter paper
5. Set up vacuum on table outside of BSC
6. Place filter base into filtration flask 
7. Connect tubing into side arm of filtration flask 
8. Place a 0.22 um filter paper onto top of filter base
9. Place glass filter funnel on filter base
10. Use clamp to secure filter base and filter funnel
11. Turn on vacuum. Make sure it is vacuuming air out of the filtration flask
12. Filter PCM by pouring it into filter funnel slowly, making sure to not overflow the filter funnel
13. Transfer filtered PCM into labeled new sterile 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle
14. Store sterile PCM in 4°C fridge
## Homogenizing oyster tissue for inoculation:
### Materials: 
*Reagents needed:*
- PCM (500 uL per sample)

*Other materials:* 
- Oyster(s)
- Shucking knife
- Shucking glove 
- Plastic weigh boat 
- Two pairs of tweezers
- Two pairs of dissecting scissors 
- Beaker of ethanol (for ethanol flaming)
- Bunsen burner (for ethanol flaming)
- Beaker (for storing cooled down tools during ethanol flaming)
- Plastic bag with no holes 
- 1000 uL pipet
- Pipet tips
- Tubes with oyster tissue
- Homogenizer 150
- Plastic probe
- Two DI baths in beakers
- Bleach bath in beaker 
### Protocol: 
**Perform the following steps on the bench with a lit bunsen burner to ensure a sterile field.**
1. Label different corners of the plastic weigh boat with tissue type for keeping track of excised tissue.
2. Obtain oyster - shuck and dissect in plastic weigh boat on lab bench (to reduce mess)
	- Keep sterile between oyster samples/tissues - ethanol flame tweezers/scissors between individuals (have two sets, one working and one cooling down from the flame (in an empty sterile beaker) - *do not dissect with hot tools*)
3. If necessary, discard excess liquid from oyster into a plastic bag with no holes. This and all leftover soft oyster tissue contents will be discarded later. Oyster shells can be rinsed with water and kept in 'shell bag' in the bottom of the Narwhal freezer
4. Place samples of oyster tissue into new sterile 2 mL tubes, making sure to sterilize (ethanol-flame) tweezer between samples

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood. Take precautions to avoid contamination.**
5. Into the fume hood, bring PCM, 1000 uL pipet, pipet tips, tubes with oyster tissue, Homogenizer 150, plastic probe, two DI baths, bleach bath. 
6. Add 500uL of PCM to each sample
7. Insert sterile plastic probe into Homogenizer 150 making sure it locks into place
8. Submerge probe in 2mL tube, hovering just above the bottom; turn on Homogenizer 150 and slide speed 5 clicks to the right, hold for 10 seconds
    - Keep tubes in cold rack while homogenizing and watch for spillover
    - _Never run homogenizer dry_
9. Carefully remove probe once the homogenizer has stopped and check if any tissue is still intact; if there is visible tissue, repeat step 4
10. Clean probe immediately as follows: first DI bath 10s, bleach 10s, second DI bath 10s
11. Remove probe and leave in second DI bath
12. Repeat steps 3-5 for all samples

Due to the Homogenizer 150 getting hot with use and the potential for RNA degradation, do not exceed 10 samples without resting the equipment for 30 minutes. (_untested_)


## Inoculating Perkinsus strains into PCM:

### Materials:
- *Perkinsus marinus* strains or homogenized oyster tissue
- PCM
- 25 cm^2 culture flasks 
- 1000 uL pipet
- 1000 uL pipet tips 
- Large pipet (grey)
- 25 mL pipet tips
- Sharpie

### Protocol:

1. This initial inoculation will be P1. 
2. In the BSC, pipet 20 mL of PCM into each 25 cm^2 culture flask. If flasks are tissue treated, keep flask upright with cap of flask being at the top to avoid cells adhering
3. Label each 25 cm^2 flask with strain name and passage number (P1)
4. Pipet 500 uL of Perkinsus strain into each labeled 25 cm^2 flask
5. Keep inoculated flasks in 28°C incubator for eight days 
6. After one day of incubation, take a 20 uL sample from each strain to perform a cell count using the hemocytometer and note cell density. 
7. If cell density is 10^6 cells/mL, create P2. If cell density is less than 10^6 cells/mL, allow for cells to incubate for another day and repeat step 6 until cell density reaches 10^6 cells/mL
