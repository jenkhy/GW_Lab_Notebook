What have I learned so far?

- i have learned that the primary immune defense of oysters against pathogens is its innate immune system 
- the innate immune system uses hemocytes that engulf the pathogens 
- the oyster’s hemolymph (where the hemocytes are from) contains bacteria that naturally reside in it
- there is a question of “how do oyster hemocytes distinguish between external pathogens and inhabitant bacteria?”
- what are “pattern recognition receptors?”
	- pattern recognition receptors are receptors found on the hemocytes and the epithelial cells of oysters that recognize invading microbes and in response, activates hemocytes to engulf the pathogens 
	- when hemocytes are activated, they express Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) which will eliminate the microbes 

- pathogens that are able to bypass the hemocytes face the phagocytes
- there are some protozoans and some bacteria that can bypass both the innate immune system and the phagocytosis system of oysters, ultimately avoiding the whole oyster immune response
	- these protozoans and bacteria suppress the reactive oxygen species (ROS), (ROS and AMPs that are produced by the are involved in eliminating the pathogen)

- what does perkinsus do to an oyster?
	- causes oyster tissue to break down
	- causes blockage of the circulatory system 
- where does perkinsus infect the oyster?
	- the infection sites are in the mantle epithelium of the oyster

  

possible questions to research:
- Since P. marinus can be transmitted directly to a naive oyster via the water column, do stress factors such as irregular salinity and temperature impact how quickly P. marinus can be transmitted to a naive oyster?
	- P. marinus is known to have optimal growth around the optimal growth of oysters
