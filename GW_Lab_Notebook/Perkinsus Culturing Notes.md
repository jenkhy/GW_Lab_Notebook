- Supplementation of _Perkinsus marinus_ Cultures with Host Plasma or Tissue Homogenate Enhances Their Infectivity
	- Under Materials and Methods, Infection trials and analysis of _P. marinus_ body burden: Perkinsus is **isolated** by first incubating in RFTM, tissue was pelleted by centrifugation, pelleted tissue was suspended in 20 mL  of 2 M NaOH and held at 60°C for 3 to 4 hours to dissolve oyster tissue, enlarged perkinsus hypnospores were pelleted, washed three times in distilled water
	- "In order to most accurately and sensitively quantify the infection level following experimental infection, _P. marinus_ cells were enumerated using the whole body burden technique ([10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC321304/#r10), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC321304/#r14)). Briefly, the oyster soft tissues were finely minced and incubated at room temperature for 7 days in 20 ml of fluid thioglycolate medium (2.9% FTM; T-9032; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; 2% NaCl) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin solution (5% [vol/vol]; P-0781; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.). Following incubation, the tissue was pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 ml of 2 M NaOH, and held at 60°C for 3 to 4 h to dissolve the oyster tissue. The enlarged _P. marinus_ prezoosporangia (hypnospores) were then pelleted, washed three times in distilled water, stained with a 1:5 dilution of Lugol's iodine, immobilized on a 0.45-μm filter by vacuum, and enumerated by light microscopy. When necessary, dilutions of the hypnospores were made in distilled water and counted in triplicate, and the mean count was extrapolated to the volume of the sample. The resultant counts were log_e_ transformed for analysis of variance and for Tukey's multiple comparisons test, using a 5% error rate." (Earnhart, C. G., Vogelbein, M. A., Brown, G. D., Reece, K. S., & Kaattari, S. L. (2004).

- Isolation, culture, and optimal growth conditions for the shellfish protozoan parasite, _Perkinsus olseni
	- Under Materials and Methods, 2.2 Isolation and In Vitro Culture Initiation: Perkinsus is **isolated** by first decontaminating tissue with antibiotic solution diluted in FSSW, then Perkinsus cells were enlarged by transferring tissues into RFTM with its antibiotics and incubated at 22°C in the dark with gentle shaking, tissue samples were then inoculated into PCM, antibiotic treatment added to the inoculated PCM, incubated in dark at 22°C and shaken at 20 rpm. 
	- _Perkinsus_ sp. cells were isolated from _P. canaliculus_ following methods previously described by [Dungan and Reece (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751925000736?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=980221eed94fc952#b0125), with minor modifications. Mussels were shucked, 1 cm2 of gill, mantle and labial [palp](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/palps "Learn more about palp from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") tissue was excised using sterile scissors, rinsed with filtered sterilized seawater (0.22 µm, FSSW) and decontaminated in three times x 1 h bath of antibiotic solution consisting of 400 mgL-1 [Streptomycin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/streptomycin "Learn more about Streptomycin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") sulphate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 400 mUL-1 Penicillin G (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mgL-1 [Nystatin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nystatin "Learn more about Nystatin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Sigma-Aldrich), and 50 mgL-1 [Chloramphenicol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/chloramphenicol "Learn more about Chloramphenicol from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted in FSSW. To enlarge the _Perkinsus_ cells and stimulate the hypnospore production ([Ray, 1952](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751925000736?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=980221eed94fc952#b0335)), tissues were then transferred to Ray’s fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM, Millipore, USA) culture with incorporated antibiotics (200 mgL-1 Streptomycin sulphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 mUL-1Penicillin G (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mgL-1 Nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mgL-1Chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich)), diluted in FSSW and incubated at 22°C in the dark with gentle shaking. After 72 h incubation, cell enlargement was observed under an inverted [light microscope](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/light-microscope "Learn more about light microscope from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (CKX53, X20, Olympus Life Science, Japan), and *Perkinsus* hypnospore density was assessed. Samples containing more than 50 hypnospores per mL−1 were inoculated into a 2 mL well plate containing DMEM-Ham's F12 (Sigma-Aldrich) (3% [fetal bovine serum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fetal-bovine-serum "Learn more about fetal bovine serum from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 0.1% lipids mixture (1000X, sigma Aldrich L5146)) propagating medium, 29 ppt (850 mOsm. Kg−1) prepared as described in [Burreson et al. (2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751925000736?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=980221eed94fc952#b0055). Antibiotic treatment, consisting of 200 mgL-1Streptomycin sulphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 mUL-1 Penicillin G (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mgL-1Nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 mgL-1 Chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted in FSSW were added to each well and incubated in the dark at 22 °C and shaken at 20 rpm. Media (50%) were renewed weekly and the two best isolates that exhibited high proliferation by [schizogony](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/schizogony "Learn more about schizogony from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") were selected and expanded by subculture in DMEM from which antibiotics were gradually eliminated until a pure [sterile culture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/axenic-culture "Learn more about sterile culture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") was obtained.
