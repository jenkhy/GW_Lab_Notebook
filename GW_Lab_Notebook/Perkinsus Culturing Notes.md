- Perkinsus culturing media has been made and is in the fridge
- Two oysters will be used for the initial experiment, one rectum sample and one mantle sample will be taken from each oyster

	- Under materials and methods, Infection trials and analysis of _P. marinus_ body burden: Perkinsus is isolated by first incubating in RFTM, tissue was pelleted by centrifugation, pelleted tissue was suspended in NaOH and held at 60° to dissolve oyster tissue, enlarged perkinsus hypnospores were pelleted, washed three times in distilled water
	- "In order to most accurately and sensitively quantify the infection level following experimental infection, _P. marinus_ cells were enumerated using the whole body burden technique ([10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC321304/#r10), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC321304/#r14)). Briefly, the oyster soft tissues were finely minced and incubated at room temperature for 7 days in 20 ml of fluid thioglycolate medium (2.9% FTM; T-9032; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; 2% NaCl) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin solution (5% [vol/vol]; P-0781; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.). Following incubation, the tissue was pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 ml of 2 M NaOH, and held at 60°C for 3 to 4 h to dissolve the oyster tissue. The enlarged _P. marinus_ prezoosporangia (hypnospores) were then pelleted, washed three times in distilled water, stained with a 1:5 dilution of Lugol's iodine, immobilized on a 0.45-μm filter by vacuum, and enumerated by light microscopy. When necessary, dilutions of the hypnospores were made in distilled water and counted in triplicate, and the mean count was extrapolated to the volume of the sample. The resultant counts were log_e_ transformed for analysis of variance and for Tukey's multiple comparisons test, using a 5% error rate." (Earnhart, C. G., Vogelbein, M. A., Brown, G. D., Reece, K.
