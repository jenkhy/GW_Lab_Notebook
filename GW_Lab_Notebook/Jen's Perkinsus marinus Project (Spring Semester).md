**To-Do List:** 
- New oysters need to be bought from Whole Foods 
	- Four adult Cotuit Oysters from MA, USA [[Oyster Kinds]]
	- Four adult Atlantic Blue Point Oysters from CT, USA [[Oyster Kinds]]
- Check the algae agar plates for growth 
- Streak an agar plate with the old Tetraselmis chuii stock 
- Cell counts for old algae carboys and new algae carboys 
- Read papers to learn how to use a technique for obtaining and culturing Perkinsus

[[P. marinus Notes]] 
- The optimum salinity for P. marinus to thrive is 25-30 ppt

**Streaking agar plates with Old Tetraselmis chuii Stocks** 
- Three agar plates, each containing T. chuii from the three old stock flasks, were incubated at 28° C on Friday Jan 10, 2025
	- T. chuii 1 is placed directly under the light source 
	- T. chuii 2 and T. chuii 3 are placed above the light source and are exposed to light indirectly
	- The light source runs on a timer
		- Light on for two hours, light off for two hours 

**Cell Counts for Old and New Algae Carboys** 
*Note: Maximum concentration for T. chuii is 30x10^6 cells/mL*
- Tetrasemis chuii 
	- Old Tetraselmis: 2.78 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- New Tetraselmis: 7 x 10^4 cells/mL
*Note: Maximum concentration for I. galbana is 20x10^6 cells/mL*
- Isochrysis galbana
	- Old Isochrysis galbana: 6.3 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Isochrysis galbana: <10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- No living isochrysis
		- Tetraselmis contamination
*Note: Maximum concentration for Chaetoceros is 8.88x10^6*
- Chaetoceros
	- Old Chaetoceros: 3.83 x 10^6 cells/mL (Chaetoceros concentration), 5 x 10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Chaetoceros: 9.1 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination

[[Protocol for Culturing Perkinsus]]

**How to Culture Perkinsus** 
1. Place finely minced oyster tissues in Petri dishes (La Peyre, et al. 1993) 
2. Wash minced tissue five times with YRW
3. Resuspend minced tissue in a culture medium (as seen below) and place into culture flasks 
4. Incubate cultures at 21°C 
- Culture medium (La Peyre, et al. 1996): 
	- 1:1 DME (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's base medium) to Ham's F12 to increase the growth of P. marinus
- Supplement: 
	- FBS 10%
	- Oyster plasma 5%
- Buffer: 
	- HEPES 100 mM
- Antibiotic
	- Penicillin G 100 U/mL
