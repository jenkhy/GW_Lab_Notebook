**To-Do List:** 
- New oysters need to be bought from Whole Foods 
	- Four adult Cotuit Oysters from MA, USA [[Oyster Kinds]]
	- Four adult Atlantic Blue Point Oysters from CT, USA [[Oyster Kinds]]
- Check the algae agar plates for growth 
- Streak an agar plate with the old Tetraselmis chuii stock 
- Cell counts for old algae carboys and new algae carboys 
- Read papers to learn how to use a technique for obtaining and culturing Perkinsus

[[P. marinus Notes]] 
- The optimum salinity for P. marinus to thrive is 25-30 ppt

**Streaking agar plates with Old Tetraselmis chuii Stocks** 
- Three agar plates, each containing T. chuii from the three old stock flasks, were incubated at 28° C on Friday Jan 10, 2025
	- T. chuii 1 is placed directly under the light source 
	- T. chuii 2 and T. chuii 3 are placed above the light source and are exposed to light indirectly
	- The light source runs on a timer
		- Light on for two hours, light off for two hours 
- Plates were examined on Monday, January 13, 2025
	- White growth was observed on T. chuii 2 and T. chuii 3 plates

**Cell Counts for Old and New Algae Carboys** 
*Note: Maximum concentration for T. chuii is 30x10^6 cells/mL*
- Tetrasemis chuii 
	- Old Tetraselmis: 2.78 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- New Tetraselmis: 7 x 10^4 cells/mL
*Note: Maximum concentration for I. galbana is 20x10^6 cells/mL*
- Isochrysis galbana
	- Old Isochrysis galbana: 6.3 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Isochrysis galbana: <10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- No living isochrysis
		- Tetraselmis contamination
*Note: Maximum concentration for Chaetoceros is 8.88x10^6*
- Chaetoceros
	- Old Chaetoceros: 3.83 x 10^6 cells/mL (Chaetoceros concentration), 5 x 10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Chaetoceros: 9.1 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination


[[Protocol for Perkinsus marinus Assay]]

3/27/2025
- 1 L of Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM) was made using:
	- 16 g/L saltwater with instant ocean
	- 4.2 g/L DME
	- 5.4 g/L Ham's F12
	- 0.15 g/L L-glutamine
	- 0.015 g/L Glycine betaine 
	- 0.5 g/L glucose
	- 0.65 g/L Sodium bicarbonate
- PCM was filtered through a 0.22 um filter, transferred into a sterile container, and kept in a 4°C fridge
4/3/2025
- P1 was created 
	- The volume of media in each culture plate: 10 mL 
	- Number of culture flasks used: six
	- Amount of strain pipetted into each flask: 0.5 mL
	- Strains:
		- PRA393
		- PRA240
		- LICT-1
		- CI3-II
		- DBNJ-1
		- TXsc
- P2
	- Planning on moving media from culture plates into vertical culture flasks for P2
