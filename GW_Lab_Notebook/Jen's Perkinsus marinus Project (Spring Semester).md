**To-Do List:** 
- New oysters need to be bought from Whole Foods 
	- Four adult Cotuit Oysters from MA, USA
	- Four adult Atlantic Blue Point Oysters from CT, USA
- Check the algae agar plates for growth 
- Streak an agar plate with the old Tetraselmis chuii stock 
- Cell counts for old algae carboys and new algae carboys 
- Read papers to learn how to use a technique for obtaining and culturing Perkinsus

**Cell Counts for Old and New Algae Carboys** 
*Note: Best concentration for T. chuii is 30x10^6 cells/mL*
- Tetrasemis chuii 
	- Old Tetraselmis: 2.78 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- New Tetraselmis: 7 x 10^4 cells/mL
- Isochrysis galbana
	- Old Isochrysis galbana: 6.3 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Isochrysis galbana: <10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- No living isochrysis
		- Tetraselmis contamination
- Chaetoceros
	- Old Chaetoceros: 3.83 x 10^6 cells/mL (Chaetoceros concentration), 5 x 10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Chaetoceros: 9.1 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination


**How to Identify Oysters with Perkinsus** 
*Note to self: Keep in mind that this procedure is solely for identifying Perkinsus and is separate from culturing Perkinsus*
- First, incubate oyster tissue in Ray's Fluid Thioglycollate Media (RFTM) at 27Â°C for 5-7 days to enlarge the P. marinus cells
- Stain oyster tissue with 2-5 drops of Lugol's Iodine under a dissecting microscope
