**Notes about P. marinus**
- The optimum salinity for P. marinus to thrive is 25-30 ppt

**Streaking agar plates with Old Tetraselmis chuii Stocks** 
- Three agar plates, each containing T. chuii from the three old stock flasks, were incubated at 28° C on Friday Jan 10, 2025
	- T. chuii 1 is placed directly under the light source 
	- T. chuii 2 and T. chuii 3 are placed above the light source and are exposed to light indirectly
	- The light source runs on a timer
		- Light on for two hours, light off for two hours 

**Cell Counts for Old and New Algae Carboys** 
*Note: Maximum concentration for T. chuii is 30x10^6 cells/mL*
- Tetrasemis chuii 
	- Old Tetraselmis: 2.78 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- New Tetraselmis: 7 x 10^4 cells/mL
*Note: Maximum concentration for I. galbana is 20x10^6 cells/mL*
- Isochrysis galbana
	- Old Isochrysis galbana: 6.3 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Isochrysis galbana: <10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- No living isochrysis
		- Tetraselmis contamination
*Note: Maximum concentration for Chaetoceros is 8.88x10^6*
- Chaetoceros
	- Old Chaetoceros: 3.83 x 10^6 cells/mL (Chaetoceros concentration), 5 x 10^4 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination
	- New Chaetoceros: 9.1 x 10^5 cells/mL (Tetraselmis contamination concentration)
		- Tetraselmis contamination


**How to Identify Oysters with Perkinsus** 
*Note to self: Keep in mind that this procedure is solely for identifying Perkinsus and is separate from culturing Perkinsus*
- First, incubate oyster tissue in Ray's Fluid Thioglycollate Media (RFTM) at 27°C for 5-7 days to enlarge the P. marinus cells
- Stain oyster tissue with 2-5 drops of Lugol's Iodine under a dissecting microscope

**How to Culture Perkinsus** 
1. Place finely minced oyster tissues in Petri dishes (La Peyre, et al. 1993) 
2. Wash minced tissue five times with YRW
3. Resuspend minced tissue in a culture medium (as seen below) and place into culture flasks 
4. Incubate cultures at 21°C 
- Culture medium (La Peyre, et al. 1996): 
	- 1:1 DME (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's base medium) to Ham's F12 to increase the growth of P. marinus
- Supplement: 
	- FBS 10%
	- Oyster plasma 5%
- Buffer: 
	- HEPES 100 mM
- Antibiotic
	- Penicillin G 100 U/mL

Protocol for Perkinsus marinus assay:
I. Preparing the RFTM
1. In a beaker with a stir bar, combine 14.6 g FTM powder, 10 g NaCl, and 485 mL distilled water
2. Cover the flask with foil, and set heat to 55°C with stirring power at 300-400 rpm until near boiling
3. Allow to cool briefly before adding chloramphenicol (antibiotic) with stirring, this is now your RFTM
4. Fill (125 mL - 500 mL) autoclavable screw capped bottles to 75% capacity for room for heated RFTM, keep bottle caps loose for venting
5. Autoclave RFTM at 121°C for 20 minutes
6. Allow RFTM to cool in a sterile environment, once they have cooled to room temp, close the bottle caps tightly
7. Wrap RFTM in foil or tape to keep in dark at room temperature, can be used for 2-3 months, refrigeration allows for storage for a year 
II. RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues
1. Under the biosafety cabinet, aliquot 1 mL of RFTM into four 1.5 mL  tubes
2. Label the four 1.5 tubes as follows
	a. Mantle 
	b. Gills
	c. Heart
	d. Rectum
1. Gently add 2-4 drops of nystatin suspension to inhibit fungus growth
2. Under the biosafety cabinet, excise small pieces (3-5 mm) of oyster mantle, gill, and heart and inoculate each tissue into each respective 1.5 mL tube
3. Cap tubes loosely, and incubate for 7 days in the dark at 27° (20°C to 30°C is effective)
III. RFTM assay analysis
1. Create 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution
2. Label four microscope slides as follows, and add a small pool of Iodine solution to each slide:
	a. Mantle 
	b. Gills
	c. Heart
	d. Rectum
3. 
	
Protocol for culturing:
1. Obtain an adult Beavertail Oyster
2. Disinfect bench workspace with 70% ethanol
3. Obtain four 1.5 mL tubes and label as follows
	a. Mantle
	b. Gills
	c. Hemolymph
	d. Heart
4. Fill
