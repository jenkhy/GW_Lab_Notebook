The three species of algae we have are Tetraselmis chuii, Isochrysis galbana, and Chaetoceros

When opening anything that has algae in it, it must be done in the biosafety cabinet, but since the algae carboys upstairs are so heavy it would be inefficient to have to carry it to a sterile workspace every time we open it. It is okay that we open the carboys very quickly to add more saltwater because we will make everything else that we will put into the carboys as sterile as possible.

Optimum environment by species: 

- Temperature: 
	- 16 to 27 C
	- Optimum temperature is 24 C
	- Room temperature is 20-22 C
- Salinity: 
	- Diatoms (Chaetoceros)
		- 20-25 psu
		- We have 20 psu saltwater 
	- Flagellates (Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis Chuii)
		- 25-30 psu
		- We have 25 psu saltwater 

  
Weekly/Daily Tasks 
- All cultures in flasks, carboys, etc. must be swirled at least once a day, this is to prevent self-shading and settling
- Constantly add more saltwater with F/2 media to cultures twice a week
- Add 39 uL of F/2 media to stocks once a week

How to Use the Autoclave
- Materials for autoclave 
	- Cart
	- Autoclave bin 
	- Foil
	- Autoclave Tape
	- Sharpie
	- Two 4000 mL flasks
- Autoclaving saltwater 
	- From the lab, gather cart, autoclave bin, two 4000 mL flasks, foil, autoclave tape, and sharpie
	- With a sharpie and autoclave tape, label on each flask what psu saltwater will be in that flask 
	- In autoclave room, fill one 4000 mL flask with 3000 mL of 20 psu saltwater, this will be used for Chaetoceros
	- In autoclave room, fill one 4000 mL flask with 3000 mL of 25 psu saltwater, this will be used for Tetraselmis chuii/Isochrysis galbana
	- Securely cover the opening of the flask with enough foil, add autoclave tape onto foil
	- Using autoclave gloves place flasks and bin into autoclave and set autoclave to "liquid" setting
	- Fill out autoclave log
	- Do not pour autoclaved saltwater into algae culture immediately while saltwater is still hot, this will kill the algae, wait until the next day to use the autoclaved saltwater
- Autoclaving glassware
	- Glassware that will hold the algae culture (algae stock, saltwater, and F/2 media) must be autoclaved before algae, autoclaved saltwater, and F/2 media are put in
	- Cover openings of empty glassware with foil and autoclave tape securely
	- Place in autoclave bin and autoclave in the autoclave on sixth floor using gravity option
	- If other dry items need to be autoclaved as well, such as rubber stopper and tubing apparatus, these items can be autoclaved together using gravity option
- Autoclaving rubber stoppers and tubing
	- Stopper and tubing apparatus must be autoclaved before plugging into air pump and into glassware holding the algae culture 
	- Pull tubing through opening of rubber stopper
	- If tubing does not fit, carve the opening with a scalpel or knife as needed 
	- Completely wrap the stopper and tubing apparatus with foil and cover with autoclave tape 
	- Place in autoclave bin and autoclave in the autoclave on sixth floor using gravity option 
	- If other dry items need to be autoclaved as well, such as empty glassware, these items can be autoclaved together using gravity option

Adding autoclaved saltwater with F/2 Media to Algae Carboys 
- Materials needed for adding autoclaved saltwater with F/2 Media to Algae Carboys 
	- F/2 media (found in manatee fridge)
	- Biosafety cabinet
	- Grey pipet 
	- Disposable serological pipet tip
	- Bleach 
- Make sure to add F/2 media after one day when autoclaved saltwater has been cooled
- Make sure to add this F/2 Media + Saltwater to the carboys as soon as possible after adding the F/2 media
- In the biosafety cabinet, disinfect the work area with 10% bleach
- Bring both flasks of saltwater and F/2 Media bottle into biosafety cabinet
- Add 3 mL of F/2 Media to 3000 mL of each saltwater

Using the hemocytometer to count algae cells 
1. Use 70% ethanol for cleaning the coverslip of the hemocytometer before use
2. Gently dry with Kimwipe 
3. Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another small beaker with DI water
4. Without gloves, swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer 
5. Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing with your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count 
6. Rinse the hemocytometer under tap water
7. Swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with DI water 
8. Use Kimwipes to dry the hemocytometer with gentle wiping movements 
9. In the biosafety cabinet, pipette 10 uL of algae into each of the two chambers of the hemacytometer 
10. Count total viable cells (cells with color) in four corner squares and center square 
11. When counting, count any cells on the bottom line and right line of each square 

- To clean the hemocytometer after use: 
	- Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another beaker with DI water
	- Without gloves, swish the hemoctometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer
	- Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count
	- Do the same with the cover slip of the hemocytometer

- Calculations using hemocytometer: 
	- Concentration, aka viable cells per mL = (avg # of cells per square * dilution factor * 10^4)
	- To find avg # of cells per square = (total # of viable cells / # of squares used)
	- The dilution factor will be 1 since no dyes are being used 

Best concentration of algae to feed oysters:
- Under 7.5 x 10^5 cells/mL is the best concentration of algae to feed the oysters, this is when the algae is in late log phase or early stationary phase
- Do not exceed density of 7.5 x 10^5 cells/mL



Saltwater 
- Materials for making saltwater: 
	- Empty instant ocean buckets 
	- Instant ocean 
	- DI water 
	- Orion Star Meter (on field rack 2/3)
- Making saltwater
	- Fill a bucket with DI water, leaving enough space for stirring the water 
	- Add Instant Ocean salt little by little while continuously measuring the salinity with the orion star meter 
	- After adding salt, stir, and hit "measure" on the orion star meter. Repeat this until reached desired salinity 
	- For diatoms (Chaetoceros) we make 20 psu saltwater
	- The acceptable range for diatoms is 20-25 psu
	- Aim for a psu a little over 20 psu, this way if the psu ends up measuring a little higher it can still be in the 20-25 range rather than if we aimed for 25 psu and the psu accidentally raised to out of that 20-25 psu range
	- For flagellates (Tetraselmis chuii and Isochrysis galbana) we make 25 psu saltwater 
	- The acceptable range for diatoms is 25-30 psu
	- Aim for a psu a little over 25 psu, this way if the psu ends up measuring a little higher it can still be in the 25-30 range rather than if we aimed for 30 psu and the psu accidentally raised to out of that 25-30 psu range
