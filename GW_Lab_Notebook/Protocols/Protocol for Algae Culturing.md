Preparation for inoculation: 
- Sterilization: 
	- Autoclaving Saltwater
		- Use large plastic beaker to pour saltwater into 4000 mL flask 
		- If autoclaving multiple salinities of saltwater, make note of which flask contains which salinity 
		- Cover openings of the flask with foil and autoclave tape securely
		- Place in autoclave bin and autoclave in the autoclave on sixth floor using liquid option 
		- Do not pour autoclaved saltwater into algae culture immediately while saltwater is still hot, this will kill the algae, wait until the next day to use the autoclaved saltwater

	- Autoclaving glassware
		- Glassware that will hold the algae culture (algae stock, saltwater, and F/2 media) must be autoclaved before algae, autoclaved saltwater, and F/2 media are put in
		- Cover openings of empty glassware with foil and autoclave tape securely
		- Place in autoclave bin and autoclave in the autoclave on sixth floor using gravity option
		- If other dry items need to be autoclaved as well, such as rubber stopper and tubing apparatus, these items can be autoclaved together using gravity option
	- Autoclaving rubber stoppers and tubing
		- Stopper and tubing apparatus must be autoclaved before plugging into air pump and into glassware holding the algae culture 
		- Pull tubing through opening of rubber stopper
		- If tubing does not fit, carve the opening with a scalpel or knife as needed 
		- Completely wrap the stopper and tubing apparatus with foil and cover with autoclave tape 
		- Place in autoclave bin and autoclave in the autoclave on sixth floor using gravity option 
		- If other dry items need to be autoclaved as well, such as empty glassware, these items can be autoclaved together using gravity option

- UV sterilization
	- UV for fifteen minutes
	- UV sterilize workspace, autoclaved glassware, autoclaved saltwater, autoclaved stopper and tubing apparatus, pipets, pipet tips
	- Do NOT UV the algae, this will kill the algae!

Inoculating 

- Inoculating (Putting the stock culture into the saltwater to make your culture) must be done in biosafety cabinet 
- Shake the F/2 media bottle prior to using it
- Keep F/2 media bottle in fridge when not using 
- There are two ways to inoculate:
	- individually adding the saltwater, algae, and F/2 media into the new glassware
	- adding saltwater that already has F/2 media in it to the algae
- Individually adding saltwater, algae, and F/2 into the new glassware:
	- If moving algae from stock culture into a 1000 mL flask:
		- Make sure the 1000 mL flask is autoclaved and UV sterilized for fifteen minutes
		- Add 495 mL of 25 psu/20 psu autoclaved saltwater to the 1000 mL flask 
		- Add 5 mL of the algae to the 1000 mL flask 
		- Add 56 uL of F/2 media to the 1000 mL flask 
	- If moving algae from stock culture into a 2400 mL flask: 
		- Make sure the 2400 mL flask is autoclaved and UV sterilized for fifteen minutes
		- Add 1960 mL of 25 psu/20 psu autoclaved saltwater to the 2400 mL flask 
		- Add 40 mL of the algae to the 2400 mL flask 
		- Add 258 uL of F/2 media to the 2400 mL flask 
	- If moving algae into a 20 L carboy: 
		- Make sure the 20 L carboy is autoclaved and UV sterilized for fifteen minutes 
		- Add 9.5 L of 25 psu/20 psu autoclaved saltwater to the 20 L carboy
		- Add 500 mL of the algae to the 20 L carboy
		- Add 1.29 mL of F/2 media 
- Adding saltwater that already has F/2 media in it to the algae
	- For every 1000 mL of saltwater, add 1 mL of F/2 media
	- Add this saltwater / F/2 media solution to algae culture 


Materials for connecting culture to airway system: 
- Algae culture
- Autoclaved stoppers
- Autoclaved tubing 
- Rubber band 
- Small amount of foil 

Preparation for connecting culture to airway system: 
- UV sterilize the autoclaved stoppers, autoclaved tubing, scissors, rubber band, foil, and parafilm for fifteen minutes
- Place stopper into opening of flask, pull tubing through hole of stopper if the apparatus has not been made already
- pull enough tubing so that opening of tubing is inside the culture
- Secure any openings with parafilm to the best of ability so no air can escape 
- Use rubber band to secure parafilm around neck of flask 
- Use foil to wrap the end of the tubing that is outside of the flask, this will keep it sterile as possible when we bring the flask and tubing apparatus upstairs

Connecting culture to airway system 
- Bring flask and tubing apparatus upstairs to autoclave room on sixth floor
- Turn the air pump off and connect the tube to the air pump 
- Turn the air pump back on and make sure the air is visibly bubbling in the flask 

Using the hemocytometer to count algae cells 
1. Use 70% ethanol for cleaning the coverslip of the hemacytometer 
2. Gently dry with Kimwipe 
3. Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another small beaker with DI water
4. Without gloves, swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer 
5. Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing with your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count 
6. Rinse the hemocytometer under tap water
7. Swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with DI water 
8. Use Kimwipes to dry the hemocytometer with gentle wiping movements 
9. In the biosafety cabinet, pipette 10 uL of algae into each of the two chambers of the hemacytometer 
10. Count total viable cells (cells with color) in four corner squares and center square 
11. When counting, count any cells on the bottom line and right line of each square 
12. Count total non viable cells (cells with no color) on the bottom line and right line of each square

- To clean the hemocytometer after use: 
	- Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another beaker with DI water
	- Without gloves, swish the hemoctometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer
	- Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count
	- Do the same with the cover slip of the hemocytometer

- Calculations using hemocytometer: 
	- Concentration, aka viable cells per mL = (avg # of cells per square * dilution factor * 10^4)
	- To find avg # of cells per square = (total # of viable cells / # of squares used)
	- For us, dilution factor will always be 1
- Best concentration of algae to feed oysters:
	- 10^6 cells/mL is the best density of algae to feed the oysters, this is when the algae is in late log phase or early stationary phase

Materials for making saltwater: 
- Empty instant ocean buckets 
- Instant ocean 
- DI water 
- Orion Star Meter (on field rack 2/3)

Making Saltwater 
- Fill a bucket with DI water, leaving enough space for stirring the water 
- Add Instant Ocean salt little by little while continuously measuring the salinity with the orion star meter 
- After adding salt, stir, and hit "measure" on the orion star meter. Repeat this until reached desired salinity 
- For diatoms (Chaetoceros) we make 20 psu saltwater
- The acceptable range for diatoms is 20-25 psu
- Aim for a psu a little over 20 psu, this way if the psu ends up measuring a little higher it can still be in the 20-25 range rather than if we aimed for 25 psu and the psu accidentally raised to out of that 20-25 psu range
- For flagellates (Tetraselmis chuii and Isochrysis galbana) we make 25 psu saltwater 
- The acceptable range for diatoms is 25-30 psu
- Aim for a psu a little over 25 psu, this way if the psu ends up measuring a little higher it can still be in the 25-30 range rather than if we aimed for 30 psu and the psu accidentally raised to out of that 25-30 psu range

Weekly/Daily Tasks 
- All cultures in flasks, carboys, etc. must be swirled at least once a day, this is to prevent self-shading and settling
- Constantly add more saltwater and more F/2 media to cultures 
- Add 258 uL of F/2 media once or twice a week
- Chaetoceros lives in 20-25 psu saltwater 
- Tetraselmis chuii and Isochrysis galbana live in 25-30 psu saltwater
