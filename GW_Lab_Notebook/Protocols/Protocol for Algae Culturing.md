#AlgaeSpecies 
- We currently have three species of algae:
	- *Tetraselmis chuii*
		- T. chuii is a type of flagellate algae 
		- T. chuii is the most aggressive and competitive of the three, it is likely that T. chuii will contaminate another species' carboy
		- T. chuii appear green and oval-shaped under the microscope 
		- T. chuii are 4 to 15 um in size in diameter
	- *Isochrysis galbana*
		- I. galbana is a type of flagellate algae
		- I. galbana appear yellow and circular shaped under the microscope
		- I. galbana are 2 to 6 um in size in diameter
	- *Chaetoceros spp.*
		- Chaetoceros is a type of diatom algae 
		- Chaetoceros appear as brown chains under the microscope 
		- Chaetoceros are <10 to 50 um in size 
- Optimum environment for algae 
	- Optimum environment for all algae
		- 16° C to 27° C; optimum temperature is 24° C
	- Optimum salinity for algae 
		- Diatoms (Chaetoceros)
			- 20-25 psu
			- Use 20 psu saltwater
		- Flagellates (Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis chuii)
			- 25-30 psu
			- Use 25 psu saltwater
- The maximum concentration of algae to feed oysters before algae population crashes (Use #UsingHemocytometer  to determine concentration)
	- Tetraselmis chuii
		- 30 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- Isochrysis galbana
		- 20 x10^6 cells/mL
	- Chaetoceros
		- 8.88 x 10^6 cells/mL
	#Monthly/Weekly/DailyTasks 
	-  All algae cultures in flasks and carboys must be swirled once a day to prevent self-shading and settling
	- Making saltwater once a month/ whenever saltwater runs out
		- Materials for making saltwater:
			- Empty Buckets
			- Instant Ocean (Salt)
			- DI Water
			- Orion Star Meter
			- Stirrer
		- Calibrate the Orion Star Meter 
		- Fill a bucket with DI water leaving about four inches of space before the bucket fills for room to stir 
		- Add Instant Ocean salt while continuously measuring the salinity with the Orion Star Meter 
		- Hit measure to read the salinity levels, and repeat until the desired salinity is reached
	- Add saltwater + F/2 media to algae carboys three times a week
		- Autoclave approximately 3000 mL of saltwater 
		- When autoclaved saltwater is cooled the next day, add 3 mL of F/2 media under a sterile biosafety cabinet
		- Pour saltwater + F/2 media mixture into algae carboy
	#UsingHemocytometer 
1. Use 70% ethanol for cleaning the coverslip of the hemocytometer before use
2. Gently dry with Kimwipe 
3. Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another small beaker with DI water
4. Without gloves, swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer 
5. Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing with your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count 
6. Rinse the hemocytometer under tap water
7. Swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with DI water 
8. Use Kimwipes to dry the hemocytometer with gentle wiping movements 
9. In the biosafety cabinet, pipette 10 uL of algae into each of the two chambers of the hemacytometer 
10. Count total viable cells (cells with color) in four corner squares and center square 
11. When counting, count any cells on the bottom line and right line of each square 

- To clean the hemocytometer after use: 
	- Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water and fill another beaker with DI water
	- Without gloves, swish the hemoctometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer
	- Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing your fingers four times, and after rubbing for the fourth time, swish the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time and do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count
	- Do the same with the cover slip of the hemocytometer

- Calculations using hemocytometer: 
	- Concentration, aka viable cells per mL = (avg # of cells per square * dilution factor * 10^4)
	- To find avg # of cells per square = (total # of viable cells / # of squares used)
	- The dilution factor will be 1 since no dyes are being used 

#CulturingAlgaeFromStocks 
1. Obtain algae starter cultures 
2. Create a stock culture
	- In a 500 mL flask, autoclave 295 mL of saltwater at liquid setting 
	- Under a biosafety cabinet when the autoclaved saltwater has cooled to room temperature (takes one day), add 39 uL of F/2 media and 5 mL of algae to the 500 mL flask of autoclaved saltwater
3. After one week, add 65 uL of F/2 media to the 500 mL flask under the biosafety cabinet
4. After three days, transfer the contents in the 500 mL flask to a 1000 mL flask:
	- In a 1000 mL flask, autoclave 460 mL of saltwater at liquid setting 
	- Under a biosafety cabinet when the autoclaved saltwater has cooled to room temperature (takes one day), add 65 uL of F/2 and 40 mL of the contents in the 500 mL flask to the 1000 mL flask of autoclaved saltwater
5. After one week, add 65 uL of F/2 media to the 1000 mL flask under the biosafety cabinet
6. After three days, transfer the contents in the 1000 mL flask to a 20 L carboy:
	- In a 4000 mL flask, autoclave 3000 mL of saltwater
	- Under a biosafety cabinet when the autoclaved saltwater has cooled to room temperature (takes one day), add 3 mL of F/2 media 
	-
