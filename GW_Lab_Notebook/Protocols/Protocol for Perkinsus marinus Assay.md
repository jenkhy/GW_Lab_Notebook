I. Preparing the RFTM
1. In a beaker with a stir bar, combine 14.6 g FTM powder, 10 g NaCl, and 485 mL distilled water
2. Cover the flask with foil, and set heat to 55°C with stirring power at 300-400 rpm until near boiling
3. Allow to cool briefly before adding chloramphenicol (antibiotic) with stirring, this is now your RFTM
4. Fill (125 mL - 500 mL) autoclavable screw capped bottles to 75% capacity for room for heated RFTM, keep bottle caps loose for venting
5. Autoclave RFTM at 121°C for 20 minutes
6. Allow RFTM to cool in a sterile environment, once they have cooled to room temp, close the bottle caps tightly
7. Wrap RFTM in foil or tape to keep in the dark at room temperature, can be used for 2-3 months, refrigeration allows for storage for a year 
II. RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues
1. Under the biosafety cabinet, aliquot 1 mL of RFTM into four 1.5 mL  tubes
2. Label the four 1.5 tubes as follows
	a. Mantle 
	b. Gills
	c. Heart
	d. Rectum
1. Gently add 2-4 drops of nystatin suspension to inhibit fungus growth
2. Obtain two Chebooktook Oysters (Canada) and two Beavertail Oysters (Rhode Island)
3. Under the biosafety cabinet, excise small pieces (3-5 mm) of each oyster's mantle, gill, and heart and inoculate each tissue into each respective 1.5 mL tube
4. Cap tubes loosely, and incubate for 7 days in the dark at 27° (20°C to 30°C is effective)
III. RFTM assay analysis
1. Create 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution
2. Label four microscope slides as follows, and add a small pool of 30 % (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to each slide:
	a. Mantle 
	b. Gills
	c. Heart
	d. Rectum
3. With a clean probe, tease each tissue in the iodine solution apart, add another drop of 30 % (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution if needed, and mount a coverslip over the stained tissue
4. Examine under microscope for spherical, blue-black *Perkinsus* sp. cells with diameters of 10-100 um
5. Determine which oysters have Perkinsus
