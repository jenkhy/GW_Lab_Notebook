Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol, if not autoclaved already:
- Two 1000 mL autoclavable glass bottles
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 1000 mL filtration flask 
- Filtration flask tubing

### Making 1 L of Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM):

**Materials:**
- DI water
- Instant Ocean 
- DME
- Ham's F12
- L-glutamine
- Glycine betaine
- Glucose
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Weigh paper/Weigh boat
- Spatula
- 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle or larger
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 0.22 um filter paper
- 1000 mL filtration flask
- Vacuum
- Large filtration flask tubing

**Protocol:** 
1. Make 16 g/L saltwater with instant ocean by adding 16 g of instant ocean to 1000 mL of DI water in 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle 
2. To the 16 g/L saltwater in the 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle, add:
	- 4.2 g/L DME
	- 5.4 g/L Ham's F12
	- 0.15 g/L L-glutamine
	- 0.015 g/L Glycine betaine 
	- 0.5 g/L glucose
	- 0.65 g/L Sodium bicarbonate
3. This is now your PCM
4. Set up vacuum filtration apparatus in the BSC by spraying each of the following with ethanol before placing into BSC
	1. 1000 mL filtration flask
	2. 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle of PCM
	3. Large filtration flask tubing
	4. Glass filter funnel
	5. Filter base
	6. Clamp
	7. Box of 0.22 um filter paper
4. Set up vacuum on table outside of BSC
5. Place filter base into filtration flask 
6. Connect tubing into side arm of filtration flask 
7. Place a 0.22 um filter paper onto top of filter base
8. Place glass filter funnel on filter base
9. Use clamp to secure filter base and filter funnel
10. Turn on vacuum. Make sure it is vacuuming air out of the filtration flask
11. Filter PCM by pouring it into filter funnel slowly, making sure to not overflow the filter funnel
12. Store sterile PCM in 4Â°C fridge

Materials for inoculating Perkinsus strains into PCM:
- *Perkinsus marinus* strains
- PCM
- 40 mL culture flasks 
- 1000 uL pipet
- 1000 uL pipet tips 
- Large pipet (grey)
- 25 mL pipet tips
- Sharpie

Inoculating Perkinsus strains into PCM:

1. In the BSC, pipet 20 mL of media into 40 mL culture flasks
