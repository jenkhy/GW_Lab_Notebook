Materials for making 1 L of Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM):
- DI water
- Instant Ocean 
- DME
- Ham's F12
- L-glutamine
- Glycine betaine
- Glucose
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Weigh paper/Weigh boat
- Spatula
- 1000 mL glass bottle or larger

Making 1 L of PCM:
1. Make 16 g/L saltwater with instant ocean by adding 16 g of instant ocean to 1 L of DI water in 1000 mL glass bottle 
2. To the 16 g/L saltwater in the 1000 mL glass bottle, add:
	- 4.2 g/L DME
	- 5.4 g/L Ham's F12
	- 0.15 g/L L-glutamine
	- 0.015 g/L Glycine betaine 
	- 0.5 g/L glucose
	- 0.65 g/L Sodium bicarbonate
3. Filter PCM through a 0.22 um filter into a sterile container
4. Store sterile PCM in 4Â°C fridge

Materials for inoculating Perkinsus strains into PCM:
- *Perkinsus marinus* strains
- PCM
- 40 mL culture flasks 
- 1000 uL pipet
- 1000 uL pipet tips 
- Large pipet (grey)
- 25 mL pipet tips
- Sharpie

Inoculating Perkinsus strains into PCM:

1. In the BSC, pipet 20 mL of media into 40 mL culture flasks
