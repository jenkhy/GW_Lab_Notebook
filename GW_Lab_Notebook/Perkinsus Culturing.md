Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol, if not autoclaved already:
- Two 1000 mL autoclavable glass bottles or larger 
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 1000 mL filtration flask 
- Filtration flask tubing

### Making 1 L of Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM):

**Materials:**
- DI water
- Instant Ocean 
- DME
- Ham's F12
- L-glutamine
- Glycine betaine
- Glucose
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Weigh paper/Weigh boat
- Spatula
- Two 1000 mL glass screw cap bottles or larger
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 0.22 um filter paper
- 1000 mL filtration flask
- Vacuum
- Large filtration flask tubing
- Tape
- Sharpie

**Protocol:** 
1. Make 16 g/L saltwater with instant ocean by adding 16 g of instant ocean to 1000 mL of DI water in 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle 
2. To the 16 g/L saltwater in the 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle, add:
	- 4.2 g/L DME
	- 5.4 g/L Ham's F12
	- 0.15 g/L L-glutamine
	- 0.015 g/L Glycine betaine 
	- 0.5 g/L glucose
	- 0.65 g/L Sodium bicarbonate
3. This is now your PCM
4. Set up vacuum filtration apparatus in the BSC by spraying each of the following with ethanol before bringing into BSC
	1. 1000 mL filtration flask
	2. 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle of PCM
	3. Empty 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle 
	4. Large filtration flask tubing
	5. Glass filter funnel
	6. Filter base
	7. Clamp
	8. Box of 0.22 um filter paper
5. Set up vacuum on table outside of BSC
6. Place filter base into filtration flask 
7. Connect tubing into side arm of filtration flask 
8. Place a 0.22 um filter paper onto top of filter base
9. Place glass filter funnel on filter base
10. Use clamp to secure filter base and filter funnel
11. Turn on vacuum. Make sure it is vacuuming air out of the filtration flask
12. Filter PCM by pouring it into filter funnel slowly, making sure to not overflow the filter funnel
13. Transfer filtered PCM into labeled new sterile 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle
14. Store sterile PCM in 4°C fridge

### Inoculating Perkinsus strains into PCM:

**Materials:**
- *Perkinsus marinus* strains
- PCM
- 25 cm^2 culture flasks 
- 1000 uL pipet
- 1000 uL pipet tips 
- Large pipet (grey)
- 25 mL pipet tips
- Sharpie

**Protocol:**

1. This initial inoculation will be P1. 
2. In the BSC, pipet 20 mL of PCM into each 25 cm^2 culture flask. If flasks are tissue treated, keep flask upright with cap of flask being at the top to avoid cells adhering
3. Label each 25 cm^2 flask with strain name and passage number (P1)
4. Pipet 500 uL of Perkinsus strain into each labeled 25 cm^2 flask
5. Keep inoculated flasks in 28°C incubator for eight days 
6. After one day of incubation, take a 20 uL sample from each strain to perform a cell count using the hemocytometer and note cell density. 
7. If cell density is 10^6 cells/mL, create P2. If cell density is less than 10^6 cells/mL, allow for cells to incubate for another day and repeat step 6 until cell density reaches 10^6 cells/mL
