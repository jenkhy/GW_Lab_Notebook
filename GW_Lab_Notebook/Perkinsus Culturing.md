Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol:
- 1000 mL autoclavable glass bottle 
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 1000 mL filtration flask 
- Filtration flask tubing

### Making 1 L of Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM):

**Materials:**
- DI water
- Instant Ocean 
- DME
- Ham's F12
- L-glutamine
- Glycine betaine
- Glucose
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Weigh paper/Weigh boat
- Spatula
- 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle or larger
- Vacuum filtration apparatus (glass filter funnel, filter base, clamp)
- 0.22 um filter paper
- 1000 mL filtration flask
- Vacuum
- Large filtration flask tubing

**Protocol:** 
1. Make 16 g/L saltwater with instant ocean by adding 16 g of instant ocean to 1000 mL of DI water in 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle 
2. To the 16 g/L saltwater in the 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle, add:
	- 4.2 g/L DME
	- 5.4 g/L Ham's F12
	- 0.15 g/L L-glutamine
	- 0.015 g/L Glycine betaine 
	- 0.5 g/L glucose
	- 0.65 g/L Sodium bicarbonate
3. Set up vacuum filtration apparatus in the BSC by spraying each of the following with ethanol before placing into BSC
	1. 1000 mL filtration flask
	2. Large filtration flask tubing
	3. Glass filter funnel
	4. Filter base
	5. Clamp
	6. Box of 0.22 um filter paper
4. 
5. Place filter base into filtration flask 
6. Connect tubing into side arm of filtration flask 
7. Place a 0.22 um filter paper onto top of filter base
8. Place glass filter funnel on filter base
9. Use clamp to secure filter base and filter funnel
10. Filter PCM through a 0.22 um filter into a sterile container
11. Store sterile PCM in 4Â°C fridge
