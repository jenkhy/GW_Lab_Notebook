**Questions people may ask at symposium:**

- Can the pathogen be transmitted to humans?
	- No
- Are oysters alive when you buy them/when you shuck them?
	- Yes
- How was the pathogen discovered?
	- The pathogen was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1940s after their were mass mortalities of oysters there
- Is there a certain area where the pathogen is most prevalent?
	- Not necessarily in any area along the East coast of Canada, America, and Mexico, but it might be found more during its season 
- What is the lowest and highest salinity oysters can thrive in?
	- Oysters can survive in as low as 5 ppt and as high as 35 ppt
	- The ideal salinity for oysters is 10 ppt to 28 ppt

- What is the lowest and highest salinity the pathogen can thrive in?
	- Optimal temp of perkinsus is 28-32 C
	- P. marinus can thrive in as low as 9 ppt salinity
	- P. marinus can thrive in as high as 35 C
- What are some reasons for oyster death?
	- too high or too low temperatures, ideal range is 15 to 25 C
	- too high or too low salinity 10 to 28 ppt
	- pH levels, ideal is 7-9

- Is there is a pathogen or disease that can transmit from oyster to human?
	- Vibrio (transmitted by bacteria)
- Is there a way to cure the disease 
- how much perkinsus until it affects an oyster 
- how large are the perkinsus cells normally and how large are they when the rftm enlarges them?
	- perkinsus cells are 2-15 um
- what are the magnifications of the shown images?
- What are the oysters in the other tanks going to be used for?
