8. Place a 0.22 um filter paper onto top of filter base
9. Place glass filter funnel on filter base
10. Use clamp to secure filter base and filter funnel
11. Turn on vacuum. Make sure it is vacuuming air out of the filtration flask
12. Filter PCM by pouring it into filter funnel slowly, making sure to not overflow the filter funnel
13. Transfer filtered PCM into labeled new sterile 1000 mL glass screw cap bottle
14. Store sterile PCM in 4°C fridge

****If using obtained Perkinsus strains, skip to step III., if homogenizing oyster tissue for Perkinsus, proceed to step II.****

## II. Homogenizing oyster tissue for inoculation:
### Materials: 
*Reagents needed:*
- PCM (500 uL per sample)

*Other materials:* 
- Oyster(s)
- Shucking knife
- Shucking glove 
- Plastic weigh boat or tray
- Two pairs of tweezers
- Two pairs of dissecting scissors 
- Beaker of ethanol (for ethanol flaming)
- Bunsen burner (for ethanol flaming)
- Beaker (for storing cooled down tools during ethanol flaming)
- Plastic bag with no holes 
- 1000 uL pipet
- Pipet tips
- Labeled 2 mL tubes (for oyster tissue)
- Tube rack 
- Ice for tube rack 
- Homogenizer 150
- Plastic probe
- DI bath in beakers
### Protocol: 
**Perform the following steps on the bench with a lit bunsen burner to ensure a sterile field.**
1. UV sterilize all 2 mL tubes
2. Label different corners of the plastic weigh boat with tissue type for keeping track of excised tissue.
3. Obtain oyster - shuck and dissect mantle and rectum in plastic weigh boat on lab bench (to reduce mess)
	- Keep sterile between oyster samples/tissues - ethanol flame tweezers/scissors between individuals (have two sets, one working and one cooling down from the flame (in an empty sterile beaker) - *do not dissect with hot tools*)
4. If necessary, discard excess liquid from oyster into a plastic bag with no holes. This and all leftover soft oyster tissue contents will be discarded later. Oyster shells can be rinsed with water and kept in 'shell bag' in the bottom of the Narwhal freezer
5. Place samples of oyster tissue into new labeled UV sterilized 2 mL tubes, making sure to sterilize (ethanol-flame) tweezer between samples

**Perform the following procedure in the fume hood. Take precautions to avoid contamination.**
6. Into the fume hood, bring PCM, 1000 uL pipet, pipet tips, tubes with oyster tissue, Homogenizer 150, plastic probe, and DI bath. 
7. Add 500uL-1mL of PCM to each sample
8. Insert sterile plastic probe into Homogenizer 150 making sure it locks into place
9. Submerge probe in 2mL tube, hovering just above the bottom; turn on Homogenizer 150 and slide speed 5 clicks to the right, hold for 10 seconds
    - _Never run homogenizer dry_
10. Carefully remove probe once the homogenizer has stopped and check if any tissue is still intact; if there is visible tissue, repeat step 8
11. Clean probe immediately as follows: DI bath 10s
12. Repeat steps 9-11 for all samples

Due to the Homogenizer 150 getting hot with use and the potential for degradation, do not exceed 10 samples without resting the equipment for 30 minutes. (_untested_)




## III. Inoculating Homogenized Oyster Tissue/Perkinsus strains into PCM:

### Materials:
- Homogenized oyster tissue/Perkinsus strains
- PCM
- 25 cm^2 culture flasks 
- 1000 uL pipet
- 1000 uL pipet tips 
- Grey pipetboy 
- 25 mL pipet tips
- Sharpie

### Protocol:

1. This initial inoculation will be P1. 
2. In the BSC, pipet 20 mL of PCM into each 25 cm^2 culture flask. If flasks are tissue treated, keep flask upright with cap of flask being at the top to avoid cells adhering
3. Label each 25 cm^2 flask with strain name (if there is one) and passage number (P1)
4. Pipet 500 uL of Perkinsus strain into each labeled 25 cm^2 flask
5. Keep inoculated flasks in 28°C incubator for eight days 
6. After one day of incubation, take a 20 uL sample from each strain to perform a cell count using the hemocytometer and note cell density. 
7. If cell density is 10^6 cells/mL, create P2 (refer to step 9). If cell density is less than 10^6 cells/mL, allow for cells to incubate for another day and repeat step 6 until cell density reaches 10^6 cells/mL
8. Record how many days are between passages and record the density of cells 
9. To split the flask for P2, pellet cells via centrifuge, aspirate out the old media, and resuspend pelleted cells in a new flask containing fresh media
