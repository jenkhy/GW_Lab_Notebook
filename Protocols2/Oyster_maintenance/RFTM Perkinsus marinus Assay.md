### **Materials to autoclave before beginning protocol** (if not already autoclaved):
- Glass culturing tubes with covers 
- 600 mL beaker
- Small beaker (150 mL should be sufficient)
- Container of 25 mL glass pipet tips 
- 5 mL glass pipet tip
- Two stir bars

## I. Preparing the RFTM
### **Materials:**
***Reagents needed for 500 mL of RFTM:***
- 14.6 g FTM powder (Thioglycollate Broth)
- 10 g NaCl
- 485 mL DI water
- 0.25 g Chloramphenicol

***Other materials:***
- 1000 mL graduated cylinder
- 600 mL beaker 
- 125 - 500 mL Autoclavable glass screw cap bottles
- Stir bar 
- Foil or masking tape

### **Protocol:**
*Wear a face mask when weighing out materials with health hazard warning*
1. Add a stir bar to a 600 mL beaker
2. Add 14.6 g FTM powder, 10 g NaCl, and 485 mL distilled water to the beaker
3. Cover the flask with foil, and set heat to 95°C with stirring power at 300-400 rpm until fully dissolved, raise temperature as needed. Stirring may take up to 45 minutes 
4. Allow to cool briefly before adding 0.25 g chloramphenicol (antibiotic) with stirring, this is now your RFTM
5. Fill autoclavable screw capped bottles to 75% capacity for room for heated RFTM, keep bottle caps loose for venting. It is best to have multiple bottles of RFTM rather than one bottle in case any contamination occurs in one bottle
6. Autoclave RFTM at 121°C for 20 minutes
7. Allow RFTM to cool in a sterile environment, like a BSC, once they have cooled to room temp, close the bottle caps tightly
8. Wrap RFTM in foil or tape to keep in the dark in 4°C fridge (fridge storage allows storage for a year)

## II. RFTM inoculation with oyster tissues
### **Materials**
***Reagents needed for inoculation:*** 
-  RFTM (~25 mL per tube)
- 7 g Nystatin (for 10 mL of nystatin suspension)
- 10 mL DI water (for 10 mL of nystatin suspension)

***Other materials:***
- Glass culture tubes
- 25 mL glass pipet tips
- Grey Pipetboy
- Dropper
- Sharpie
- Multiple dissecting scissors
- Multiple pairs of tweezers 
- Small beaker
- Foil
- Oysters 
- Shucking Knife
- Shucking glove
- Weigh boats
- Plastic bag with no holes
- Beaker of 70% ethanol 
- Bunsen burner

### **Protocol:**

Wipe down all surfaces with 10% bleach before and after protocol

1. UV sterilize tweezers, dissecting scissors, and empty glass tubes with covers for five minutes
2. While tools are UV sterilizing, create a nystatin suspension by adding a stir bar into a small beaker. Add 7 parts nystatin powder to 10 parts DI water into a small beaker. 
	- To make 10 mL of nystatin suspension, add 7 g nystatin powder to 10 mL of DI water
	- Each tube will need ~1 mL of nystatin suspension, so for example 10 mL of nystatin suspension will be good for ~10 tubes 
3. Cover this beaker of nystatin suspension with foil and stir on stir plate until fully dissolved
4. Label glass tubes with important sample and ID information, such as where oyster is from, tissue type, etc.
    
**on bench**

5. Obtain oyster - shuck and dissect in plastic weigh boat on lab bench (to reduce mess)
	- *Do not shuck and dissect oysters in the BSC*
	- Keep sterile between oyster samples/tissues - ethanol flame tweezers/scissors between individuals (have two sets, one working and one cooling down from the flame (in an empty sterile beaker) - *do not dissect with hot tools*)
   	- If necessary, discard excess liquid from oyster into a plastic bag with no holes. This and all leftover soft oyster tissue contents will be discarded later. Oyster shells can be rinsed with water and kept in 'shell bag' in the bottom of the Narwhal freezer
6. Place tissue samples into their respective labeled tubes - bring to BSC when done

**in BSC**

Bring RFTM, 25 mL glass pipet tips, pipetboy, dropper, nystatin, and tubes containing samples into the BSC 

7. In the BSC, aliquot ~25 mL of RFTM into labeled glass tubes containing tissue samples
8. Gently add 2-4 drops of nystatin suspension into tubes to inhibit fungus growth.
9. Wipe surface of BSC with 10% bleach after inoculating is finished
10. Incubate for 7 days in the dark at 27° (20°C to 30°C is effective) for an RFTM assay analysis
11. Discard all soft oyster tissue in plastic bag. 

## III. RFTM assay analysis
### **Materials:**
- Lugol's iodine
- DI water
- Sterile tweezers
- Microscope slides
- Microscope coverslips
- Dropper
- Pencil

### **Protocol:**

1. UV sterilize a pair of tweezers and a dropper for five minutes
2. While waiting for tweezers to sterilize, if there is not a 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution already, create 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution by mixing 3 parts iodine solution with 7 parts DI water
3. Label microscope slides with a pencil. Slides are labeled with important sample and ID information, such as which oyster the sample is from, what species, what tissue type, etc
4. Add a small pool of 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to a labeled microscope slide
5. With sterile tweezers, tease each tissue in the iodine solution apart, add another drop of 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution if needed, and mount a coverslip over the stained tissue
6. Examine under microscope for spherical, blue-black *Perkinsus* cells with diameters of 10-100 um
7. Count and determine if there is *Perkinsus* present and how many cells are present
8. Repeat for each sample and take note of observations
9. Indicate the dermo score on the microscope slide. Refer to the Perkinsus Dermo Score Guide
	- If there are zero Perkinsus cells found, write a dermo score of (0) on the microscope slide
	- If there are <10 Perkinsus cells found, write a dermo score of (0.5)
	- If there are 10 < x < 100 Perkinsus cells found, write a dermo score of (1)
	- If there are 100 < x < 200 Perkinsus cells found, write a dermo score of (2)
	- If there are masses of about 50 cells, write a dermo score of (3)
	- If there is less than half of the tissue that appears blue-black, write a dermo score of (4)
	- If most tissue appears blue-black, write a dermo score of (5)
