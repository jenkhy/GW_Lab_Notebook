# Using the hemocytometer

A hemocytometer is a specialized slide used for manual cell counting with a microscope. There are two chambers in a hemocytometer, each containing a small 3x3 grid etched onto its surface. Here, you'll find instructions on how to use and clean one, how to calculate a cell concentration, and how to perform dilutions. We have used cell counting for algae cells and for *Perkinsus* cells. 

## Counting Algae Cells 
### Materials: 
- 70% ethanol bottle 
- Hemocytometer 
- Cover slip of hemocytometer
- Kimwipes
- Small beaker 
- Lab glassware soap
- DI water
- Lugol Solution (100% Lugol's Iodine)
- *unfiltered* pipet tips
- 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
- Algae

### Protocol:
1. Disinfect the coverslip of the hemocytometer by spraying with 70% ethanol on both sides
2. Gently dry with Kimwipe
3. Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and tap water
4. Without gloves, swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer. Be sure not to wear gloves when touching the hemocytometer as gloves have a film that can interfere with the cell count 
5. Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing the chambers of the hemocytometer with your fingers multiple times, after swishing the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time, do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count 
6. Rinse the hemocytometer under DI water
7. Use Kimwipes to dry the hemocytometer with gentle wiping movements. Make sure you have wiped off all dust and debris by holding the hemocytometer up to a light to see no debris left
8. If the density of algae in the carboy is visibly extremely low (color of algae is almost clear), pipette 10 uL of the algae into a chamber of the hemocytometer. If the algae appears sparse (there seems to be a sum of less than about 100 cells in the four corner squares), proceed to step 14. If the algae appears dense under the microscope (there seems to be a sum of more than about 100 cells in the four corner squares), proceed to step 9 to perform a dilution to make counting easier
9. Read "Dilutions" below for more information about dilutions and its importance before performing this step. Use Lugol's Iodine to perform a 1:10 dilution of Lugol's iodine in algae by adding 5 uL of Lugol's iodine to 45 uL of algae in an Eppendorf tube, there is 50 uL total
10. Pipet 10 uL of this dilution into one chamber of the hemocytometer
11. If the algae still appears dense under the microscope, proceed to step 12 to perform a different dilution. If the algae is less dense, skip to step 14 to count cells
12. Read "Dilutions" below for more information about dilutions and its importance before performing this step. Use Lugol's Iodine to perform a 1:11 dilution of algae by first making Dilution 1, then making Dilution 2. Keep in mind that you will be disregarding the dilution created in step 9 as this is a new and separate dilution. 
	1. To make Dilution 1, create a 1:10 dilution of algae in DI water. Add 5 uL of algae to 45 uL of DI water, there is 50 uL total. This is 1 part algae to 9 parts DI water, there are 10 parts total. This is now your Dilution 1
	2. To make Dilution 2, create a 1:11 dilution of 100% Lugol's Iodine in Dilution 1. Add 5 uL of Lugols to the 50 uL of Dilution 1, there is 55 uL total. This is 1 part Lugol's to 10 parts Dilution 1, there are 11 parts total. This is now your 1:11 dilution of algae.
	 NOTE: This is a final 1:11 dilution of algae because there are 5 uL of algae in a total of 55 uL of volume
13. Pipette 10 uL of algae from the 1:11 dilution of algae into one chamber of the hemocytometer 
14. Count the sum of cells in the four corner squares. Be sure to count any cells that are on the borders of each of the four squares.

### Dilutions
- What is a dilution?
	- A dilution is adding more solvent to a sample to decrease its concentration. 
- Why are dilutions important?
	- Dilutions are important because they generally make cell counts more accurate. When diluting the cells, there are less cells to count which allow for a more accurate count. There may be miscounts when the algae is too dense because there are many to count and there may be some overlapping algae that make it difficult to count. 
- How is a dilution written?
	- We will write our dilutions using the fraction notion, NOT the ratio notion. Think of a 1:10 dilution as the fraction 1/10. A 1:10 dilution would be 1 part of the original solution (algae) diluted with 9 parts of solvent (DI water), resulting in a total of 10 parts
- What is a dilution factor? How to calculate a dilution factor?
	- A dilution factor is the number you will use for calculating the concentration of algae cells (cells/mL). To find the dilution factor, divide the total volume by the initial volume. For example, a solution with 55 uL volume total containing 5 uL of algae would have a dilution factor of 55/5 = 11
- Why do we use Lugol's iodine for counting algae?
	- Lugol's iodine immobilizes and kills the algae cells, making them still and much easier to count. Lugol's iodine does not allow for you to distinguish between live and dead algae cells, as it will stain both live and dead cells. 

### Cleaning:
***please clean after EACH use, between the use of different species, and between each count***
1. Fill a small beaker with lab glassware soap and water
2. Without gloves, swish the hemocytometer in the beaker with soap, take it out, and use your fingers to gently rub the two chambers of the hemocytometer. Be sure not to wear gloves when touching the hemocytometer as gloves have a film that can interfere with cell counts
3. Repeat swishing the hemocytometer into the soap and gently rubbing the chambers of the hemocytometer with your fingers multiple times, after swishing the hemocytometer in the soap solution one last time, do not touch the surface of the device again as this will leave finger oil droplets that will interfere with the cell count 
4. Rinse the hemocytometer with DI water
5. Use Kimwipes to dry the hemocytometer with gentle wiping movements. Make sure you have wiped off all dust and debris by holding the hemocytometer up to a light to see no debris left
6. Repeat these steps with the cover slip of the hemocytometer
7. Safely store the hemocytometer and cover slip back in its box

### Calculations:

To perform calculations: 

Concentration in cells per mL = avg # of cells per square * dilution factor * 10^4
- To find the avg # of cells per square, do sum of cells / # of squares used
- To find the dilution factor, do the final volume / initial volume

(if counting algae cells for oyster feeding - see the [Algae Tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeluqx4SQUdaInXP4of0siFTtXhhd97nKfENCC8lmE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) - just enter the cell count and it auto-calculates concentration)


## Counting *Perkinsus* Cells

### Materials:
- Lugol solution
- DI water
- 25 conical screw cap tube
- Masking tape
- 1 mL tubes
- 10 uL pipet 
- 20 uL pipet
- 10-20 uL unfiltered pipet tips 
- Perkinsus cells

### Protocol:
1. Follow steps 1-7 of the Counting Algae Cells Protocol above to properly clean the hemocytometer before use
2. If not already made, in a 25 mL conical screw cap tube, create 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution by mixing 3 parts iodine solution with 7 parts DI water
3. Cover the tube with masking tape to prevent light degradation and store in a place away from direct sunlight
4. Label a 1 mL tube "DF 1.1" and with the name of the species, Perkinsus, that is being counted
5. Start with a dilution factor of 1.1 by adding 2 uL of the 30% (v/v) Lugol's iodine solution to 20 uL of algae in a 1 mL tube. Pipet up and down to mix solution
6. Pipet 10 uL of the solution into a chamber of the hemocytometer and observe
7. Increase the dilution factor by creating a new solution in a new tube if needed
