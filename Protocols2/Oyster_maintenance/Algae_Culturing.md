# Our Algae Strains
*Pavlova pingus*
*Tetraselmis sueccia*
Diatom species TBD

Ideal salinity = 28psu

# Carboy Cultures
Larger volumes of algae to feed out to oysters. Kept constantly bubbling and as sterile as possible since contamination with other algae species OR bacteria is of high concern. As these carboys are actively being used (i.e. algae is being taken out) they will need to be re-bloomed to prevent population crashes and replenish nutrients. 

## Starting a New Carboy
Goals:
- Start fresh with sterile materials and sterile algae
- Replace existing carboy that has been re-bloomed 3-4 times

Materials:
- Carboy, autoclaved
	- **Important:** only the five carboys with volumetric markings are safe to autoclave
- Large rubber stopper with three drilled holes and three hard pieces of tubing, autoclaved
- 2 modified serological pipettes, bleached and rinsed
- 2 long pieces of airline, bleached and rinsed
- 1 short piece of airline, bleached and rinsed
- 2 small airline clamps, bleached and rinsed
- 5 rubber connectors, bleached and rinsed
- DI water
- Instant Ocean
	- 476g per 15L (or 32.5g/L)
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 17mL per 17L *total volume* (or 1mL/1L)
- Liquid algae culture
	- 2L depending on density

Steps:
Outside of hood—
1. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to carboy, immediately cover with tinfoil
2. Put carboy on rolling cart and take to room 601 to fill with DI water, immediately replace tinfoil
	- Periodically swirl carboy to help dissolve salt

In the hood—

3. Spray entire hood working surface with 70% ethanol
4. Spray all materials except liquid algae culture with 70% ethanol before putting them into the hood
5. Close the hood and turn on the UV light for 5 minutes **DO NOT UV STERILIZE ALGAE**
6. Pipette f/2 media into carboy
7. Pour liquid algae culture into carboy
8. Attach serological pipettes to the bottom of the rubber stopper using rubber connectors, one is for air and one is for siphoning
	- Make sure to attach to the longer pieces of hard tubing; the shorter piece is for the exhaust
9. Put stopper on the carboy and confirm the serological pipettes do not touch the bottom
10. Attach long pieces of airline to the air and siphoning hard tubing coming out the top of the stopper
11. Attach a short piece of airline to the exhaust hard tubing coming out of the top of the stopper
12. Slide on the small airline clamps to the siphoning and exhaust airlines and squeeze them shut
13. Outside of the hood, use the mallet to lightly tap down the rubber stopper to ensure a tight seal

In the oyster room—

13. Place the carboy on the bottom shelf and attach the airline to the air pump system
14. Make sure the carboy is bubbling and then release the clamp on the exhaust

## Cleaning an Old Carboy
Goals:
- Make sure we always have sterile carboy materials on hand 
- Keep the oyster room looking fresh

Materials:
- Power drill, charged
- Rag-pole cleaning attachment
- 5 gallon bucket 
- Bleach
- DI water

Steps: 
1. Take out the rubber stopper and detach all soft tubing and rubber connectors, NOT the three hard pieces of tubing
2. Thoroughly rinse all smaller components in the sink with soap and water, flushing the tubing as best as possible
3. Make up a 5% bleach bath in the bucket using DI water
4. Submerge all smaller components, making sure there are no air pockets in the tubing, let sit for 15 minutes
5. Empty out remaining algae from the carboy into a container and feed this off to the oysters
6. Rinse out the carboy with soap and water 
7. Use the power drill and rag-pole cleaning attachment to really get the stuck-on algae bits off
8. Rinse out the carboy again and let dry
9. Drain off bleach bath while running the tap water to further dilute the bleach
10. Add DI water to the bucket and make sure there are no air pockets in the tubing, let sit for 10 minutes
11. Remove the smaller components, gently shake them dry, and then lay them out to finish air drying
12. Once smaller components are dry, but them away in their respective bins
13. Once the carboy is dry, tinfoil the top and autoclave

# Flask Cultures
Keep more sterile liquid stocks of all algae species in case of carboy contamination or population crash. Should be swirled every day and re-bloomed every week. **When handling the algae at this stage, work in the gray hood and spray things with 75% ethanol to keep things sterile. ==IMPORTANT: only open one species of algae at a time when working in the hood to prevent cross-contamination**==

## Re-bloom Flasks
Goals: 
- Keep algae at a happy growth phase
- Replenish nutrients

Materials:
- Flask, autoclaved
	- 250mL flask, max 50mL volume
	- 500mL flask, max 250mL volume
- Instant Ocean
	- 6.50g per 200mL (or 0.0325g/mL)
- DI water
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 250uL per 250mL *total volume* (or 1uL/1mL)
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- Liquid algae culture
	- 50mL depending on density
- Foam stopper, autoclaved
- Tinfoil

Steps:
Outside of hood—
1. Record how much you plan to split in the [algae flask spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeluqx4SQUdaInXP4of0siFTtXhhd97nKfENCC8lmE/edit?usp=sharing) (flask re-blooms tab) and label flasks
	- Species, date, initials, re-bloom number
2. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to flask, immediately cover with tinfoil
3. Add DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil
4. Swirl flask until dissolved

In the hood—

5. Add f/2 media to flask and swirl
6. Pipette liquid algae culture into flask and swirl
7. Put in foam stopper and return flask to the bench top, in front of the grow lights
	- Tent a piece of loose foil over the top of the foam stopper to prevent dust settling

Any extra liquid algae culture not used in the re-bloom can be fed off to the oysters upstairs as a snack! 

## Moving from Flasks to Carboy
Goals:
- Grow up algae—let's get them dividing! 

Materials:
- 2L flask, autoclaved
- Instant Ocean
	- 56.9g per 1750mL (or 0.0325g/mL)
- DI water
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 2mL per 2L *total volume* (or 1mL/1L)
- 25mL glass serological pipette, autoclaved
- Liquid algae culture
	- 250mL or the whole volume from a dense 500mL flask
- Air pump and tubing

Steps:
Outside of hood—
1. Record how much you plan to grow up in the 2L flask in the [algae flask spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeluqx4SQUdaInXP4of0siFTtXhhd97nKfENCC8lmE/edit?usp=sharing) (flask re-blooms tab) and label flasks
	- Species, date, initials, re-bloom number
2. Measure out Instant Ocean and add to flask, immediately cover with tinfoil
3. Add ~400mL DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil
4. Swirl flask until dissolved
5. Add remaining DI water to flask, immediately replace tinfoil

In the hood—

6. Add f/2 media to flask and swirl
7. Pipette or pour liquid algae culture into flask
8. Secure a piece of parafilm to the top of the flask

In the oyster room near the carboys and grow lights—

9. Use a clean (bleached) airline and connect it to the main air pump
10. Peel back the parafilm and position the airline into the 2L flask
11. Secure the airline in place with the parafilm and make sure it is bubbling
	- Algae cultures do not need an airstone

Keep an eye on the flasks to make sure 1) parafilm remains secure so there is no evaporation, 2)  airline stays in place and continues to bubble, 3) we have a sterile carboy prepared for when the 2L flask becomes sufficiently dense.

# Slant Cultures
Long-term storage of algae species that don't require regular maintenance; can stay at room temperature for 6-12 months. We want to make sure that only algae (not bacteria) grows so make sure all materials are autoclaved and work is done either over a bunsen burner or in the gray hood. These are our most sterile stocks! **When handling the agar or algae at this stage, work in the gray hood and spray things with 75% ethanol to keep things sterile.**

## Making Agar Slants
Goals: 
- Create a large agar surface area within a convenient-to-store glass test tube

Materials:
- 500mL flask
- Graduated cylinder
- Instant Ocean
	- 0.0325g per 1mL 
- DI water
- Bacto Agar
- F/2 media, sterile and kept at 4ºC
	- 1:1,000 (or 1uL/1mL)
- 25mL glass serological pipette
- Glass tubes with metal caps, autoclaved

Master-mix (16 tubes):
- 15mL saltwater per slant + 20mL extra (15 * 16 + 20 = 260mL)
- 2% agar (260 * 0.02 = 5.2g)
- f/2 media (260mL = 260uL)

Steps:
Outside the hood—
1. Weigh out Instant Ocean and add to flask
2. Add DI water to flask and swirl until dissolved
3. Weigh out Bacto Agar and add to flask
4. Use stir bar to help dissolve agar

In the hood—

5. Add f/2 media 
6. Cover flask loosely with tinfoil and autoclave for 20 minutes
7. Once moderately cool, start pipetting 15mL into each test tube, leaving the cap off
	- Because the agar will start to set as it cools you want to do this when the flask is still relatively hot, so be careful!
8. After all tubes are filled, make sure to fully eject all remaining media from the serological pipette so nothing gets stuck once the agar sets
	- If agar does get stuck: fill a 500mL flask with ~200mL water and microwave for 2 minutes, then cautiously (as the water will be very hot) submerge the pipette tip in the and use the pipette gun to expel the softened agar
9. Now rest the tubes at an almost horizontal angle (~10º) so the agar inside creates a nice gradual slope with lots of surface area
10. Once the agar is set and all condensation within the tube has evaporated, recap and wrap with a small piece of parafilm
11. Label the rack and store in 4ºC

## Plating Agar Slants - WIP
Materials: 
- Set and cooled agar slants
- 1mL dense liquid algae, preferably a new starter culture

Steps:
In the hood—

1. Uncap glass tube and pipette algae culture on top of the solid agar
2. Gently scrape the pipette tip across the top of the agar (create more surface area)
3. Recap glass tube, label appropriately with the date, and replace parafilm
4. Put on bench top in front of the grow lights

## Moving from Slants to Flask - WIP
When a liquid flask needs to be started, or if an existing one crashes, we can go back to our slants and start again with a more sterile culture!
