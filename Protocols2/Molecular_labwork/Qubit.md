**Prepare for Assay**

- Label tube lids not sides of tube
- Prepare working solution by dilution HS Reagent 1:200 in HS Buffer

- Add 190 µL of Qubit® working solution to each of the tubes **used for standards**.
- Add 10 µL of each Qubit® standard to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing 2–3 seconds. Be careful not to create bubbles.
- Add Qubit® working solution to individual assay tubes so that the final volume in each tube after adding sample is 200 µL.
    - Your sample can be anywhere from 1–20 µL. Add a corresponding volume of Qubit® working solution to each assay tube: anywhere from 180–199 µL.
- Add each sample to the assay tubes containing the correct volume of Qubit® working solution, then mix by vortexing 2–3 seconds. The final volume in each tube should be 200 µL.
- incubate tubes for at least 2 minutes before measuring in Qubit Fluorometer
    - do not hold in hands before putting into fluorometer - warms solution and results in low readings
    - after 2 mins, mixture is stable for 3 hours

On qubit:

- sign in
- select "dsDNA High Sensitivity"
- reread standards before reading samples
    - will tell you if standards are bad
    - will tell you if samples are out of range
- remove tube from fluorometer after every reading. If you need to redo a measurement, take the tube out and equilibrate to room temp for 30s
