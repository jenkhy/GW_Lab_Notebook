## RFTM Inoculation and Incubation 
### **Materials for RFTM inoculation and incubation:**
- One oyster 
- Tray and paper towel for dissection 
- Dissecting scissors 
- Forceps 
- Tweezer 
- Beaker of 100% ethanol 
- Ethanol lamp 
- Empty beaker (for storing hot tools)
- Four autoclaved 5 mL tubes (for RFTM)
- Autoclaved 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- 100 mL RFTM with antibiotics (this includes extra RFTM)
	- 5 mg nystatin
	- 500 mg chloramphenicol
	- 2 mL of pen/strap
	- 98 mL RFTM
- Stir bar
### **Protocol** for RFTM inoculation and incubation: 
**Day 0** 
1. Autoclave:
	- Full rack of 5 mL glass tubes with covers 
	- Two 100 mL screw cap bottles (one for RFTM with antibiotics and one for PCM with antibiotics)
	- Three stir bars 
**Day 1**
2. Label four 5 mL tubes: two "M" and two "R"
3. Weigh out antibiotics and measure RFTM as above into an autoclaved 100 mL screw cap bottle
4. Stir with a stir bar and stir plate if necessary
5. Set up an ethanol flaming station and sterilize forceps, tweezers, and dissecting scissors
6. On a tray and paper towel, perform a sterile dissection of the oyster by dissecting a large piece of the mantle and the rectum. Cut the mantle tissue in half, and cut the rectum tissue in half
7. Inoculate tissue samples into two tubes that will be used for iodine staining: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
8. Inoculate tissue samples into two tubes that will be used for culturing: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum tissue into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
9. Incubate two tubes for 2 days (48h) at 27°C, leave two tubes to incubate for 7 days
## Transferring Tissue from RFTM to PCM
### **Materials for transferring tissue from RFTM to PCM:**
- Small empty beaker (for discarding RFTM)
- 100 mL Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM) with antibiotics (this includes extra PCM)
	- 5 mg nystatin 
	- 500 mg chloramphenicol
	- 2 mL of pen/strap
	- 98 mL PCM
- Autoclaved 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- Ethanol lamp 
- Beaker of 100% ethanol 
- Empty beaker (for storing hot tools)
- Tweezers/forceps (for transferring tissue from RFTM to PCM)
### Protocol for transferring tissue from RFTM to PCM:
**Day 3**
1. If PCM with antibiotics has not been made already, weigh out antibiotics and measure RFTM as above into an autoclaved 100 mL screw cap bottle
2. Stir with a stir bar and stir plate if necessary
3. Label seven 5 mL tubes: "M", "M1", "M2", "R", "R1", "R2", and "C" for "control"
4. In BSC, bring the 100 mL bottle of PCM and the labeled 5 mL tubes. Pipette 2 mL of PCM into each labeled 5 mL tube (this is to keep the main 100 mL bottle of PCM sterile)
5. Take out two tubes of RFTM-inoculated tissue from the incubator: one with mantle and one with rectum 
6. On a lab bench, discard RFTM from the tubes into a beaker
7. Bring the 5 mL tubes containing PCM, "M" and "R" from the BSC. 
8. Ethanol-flame sterilize tweezers/forceps to perform a sterile transfer of tissue from the RFTM tubes into the tubes containing 2 mL PCM with antibiotics 
9. In the BSC, bring PCM-inoculated tissue and pipette up and down to disturb the tissue, this is to dislodge cells 
10. Vortex the tube to disturb the tissue if necessary
11. Inoculate 0.5 mL of "M" with disturbed oyster tissue into "M1", and 0.5 mL into "M2"
12. Inoculate 0.5 mL of "R" with disturbed oyster tissue into "R1", and 0.5 mL into "R2"
13. "C" does not contain any tissue, only containing PCM
14. Incubate these four new tubes and the fifth tube (the control) at 27°C (this may take 10-14 days)
## RFTM Assay Analysis of Tissue
***Goal**: We're aiming to determine if the oyster from which we took tissue samples to inoculate in PCM contains any Perkinsus. Performing an RFTM Assay Analysis will help us gauge the intensity of any Perkinsus infection this oyster may have had, or if it had any Perkinsus at all.*


### Materials for RFTM assay analysis of tissue:
- Two labeled microscope slides 
- Microscope slide covers
- Dropper
- 50% Iodine 
- Two pairs of tweezers
- Forceps
- Tray with paper towel (for slides)
- Beaker to pour out RFTM
- Ethanol lamp
- Beaker of ethanol
- Beaker for hot sterile tools
### Protocol for RFTM assay analysis of tissue:
**Day 7**
1. Take out the remaining two tubes in the incubator
2. Label two microscope slides "M" and "R"
3. Place a drop of 50% iodine onto each slide
4. Pour RFTM into a beaker
5. Ethanol-flame sterilize forceps to take out tissue and place onto their labeled slides into the pool of iodine
6. Ethanol-flame sterilize two pairs of tweezers to tease tissue apart
7. Add 3-4 more drops of iodine
8. Observe the stained tissue under microscope, looking for blue-black round perkinsus cells
9. Write down observations 
## Homogenizing Tissue and Transferring to Culture Flasks
### Materials for Homogenizing Tissue: 
- Homogenizer
- Homogenizer probes 
- Beaker of DI water 
- PCM-inoculated tissue in tubes (in incubator)
- Culture flasks 
- 100 mL bottle of PCM with antibiotics
- 25 cm^2 Culture Flask
### Protocol for homogenizing tissue
**Day 13**
1. In the BSC, bring 100 mL bottle of PCM with antibiotics and two 25 cm^2 culture flasks
2. Pipette 18 mL of PCM into each 25 cm^2 culture flask. If flasks are tissue-treated, keep the flask upright with the cap at the top to avoid cell adhesion. 
3. Label each 25 cm^2 culture flask with tissue type "M" or "R", and "P1" for first passage
4. Take the PCM tubes out of the incubator now that 10 days have passed
5. In fume hood, bring homogenizer, homogenizer probes, beaker of DI water, and PCM tubes
6. Insert sterile plastic probe into Homogenizer 150 making sure it locks into place
7. Submerge probe in PCM tube, hovering just above the bottom; turn on Homogenizer 150 and slide speed 5 clicks to the right, hold for 10 seconds - _Never run homogenizer dry_
8. Carefully remove probe once the homogenizer has stopped and check if any tissue is still intact; if there is visible tissue, repeat step 7
9. Clean probe immediately in DI bath for 10s
10.  Repeat steps 6-9 for all tubes
