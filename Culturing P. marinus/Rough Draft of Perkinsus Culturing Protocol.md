From paper: Dungan, Reece 2006

Materials:
- One oyster 
- Sterile dissecting scissors 
- sterile forceps 
- sterile tweezer 
- Beaker of ethanol 
- Ethanol lamp 
- Four autoclaved 5 mL tubes (for RFTM)
- 100 mL RFTM with antibiotics (this includes extra RFTM)
	- 5 mg nystatin
	- 500 mg chloramphenicol
	- 2 mL of pen/strap
	- 98 mL RFTM
- 100 mL PCM with antibiotics (this includes extra PCM)
	- 5 mg nystatin 
	- 500 mg chloramphenicol
	- 2 mL of pen/strap
	- 98 mL PCM

**Day 1**
1. Sterile dissection of the oyster tissue 
2. Cut mantle tissue in half and cut rectum tissue in half
3. Inoculate tissue samples into two tubes that will be used for iodine staining: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
4. Inoculate tissue samples into two tubes that will be used for culturing: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum tissue into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
5. Incubate two tubes for 2 days (48h) at 27°C, leave two tubes to incubate for 7 days
**Day 3**
6. Take just tissue from RFTM and inoculate into 2 mL PCM with antibiotics in a tube 
7. Pipette up and down to disturb tissue, this is to dislodge cells 
8. Obtain four new tubes each containing 2 mL PCM with antibiotics, inoculate 0.5 mL of the original PCM with oyster tissue into each new tube
9. Make an extra fifth tube of PCM with antibiotics as a control 
10. Incubate these four new tubes and the fifth tube (the control) at 27°C (this may take 10-14 days)
**Day 7**
Materials:
- Two labeled microscope slides 
- Microscope slide covers
- Dropper
- 50% Iodine 
- Two pairs of tweezers
- Forceps
- Tray with paper towel to keep slides on
- Beaker to pour out RFTM
- Ethanol lamp
- Beaker of ethanol
- Beaker for hot sterile tools
1. Take the remaining two tubes in the incubator out 
2. Label two microscope slides "M" and "R"
3. Place a drop of 50% iodine onto each slide
4. Pour RFTM into a beaker
5. Ethanol-flame sterilize forceps to take out tissue and place onto their labeled slides into the pool of iodine
6. Ethanol-flame sterilize two pairs of tweezers to tease tissue apart
7. Add 3-4 more drops of iodine
8. Observe the stained tissue under microscope, looking for blue-black round perkinsus cells
9. Write down observations 

Materials for Homogenizing: 
- Homogenizer
- Homogenizer probes 
- Beaker of DI water 
- PCM-inoculated tissue in tubes (in incubator)
- Culture flasks 
- PCM in fridge 
**Day 13**
1. Take the PCM tubes out of the incubator now that 10 days have passed
