**What requirements will I use this project towards?**
- I will use this project as my honors thesis 

**What question will this project answer?**
- Does salinity have an impact on Perkinsus marinus reproduction using in vitro culturing?

**What have I done and know so far as of now? (Fall 2025 has ended)**
- I know how to make Perkinsus Culturing Media (PCM)
- I know that homogenizing is the best method for inoculating Perkinsus into PCM 
- I know that to determine if an oyster is infected with Perkinsus, I should take part of the tissue that is to be inoculated into PCM to do an RFTM assay analysis 

**What are the plans for Spring 2025?**
- Getting used to passaging cells, then eventually counting cells:
	- Start a new batch of culturing media, and inoculate a large oyster in the hopes that it will have Perkinsus 
		- If Perkinsus cells are seen, troubleshoot passaging cells from tubes into culture flasks 
	- Use Jose's Perkinsus strains to practice culturing cells
