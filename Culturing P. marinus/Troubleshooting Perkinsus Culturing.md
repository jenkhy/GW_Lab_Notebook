- Perkinsus culturing media has been made and is in the fridge
- Two oysters will be used for the initial experiment, one rectum sample and one mantle sample will be taken from each oyster
11/4/2025
- One oyster from wild to homogenize 
- Three flasks will be made
	- One with rectum tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One with mantle tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One control with just PCM

From paper: Dungan, Reece 2006

Rough draft of protocol: 

Materials:
- One oyster 
- Sterile dissecting scissors 
- sterile forceps 
- sterile tweezer 
- Beaker of ethanol 
- Ethanol lamp 
- Four autoclaved 5 mL tubes (for RFTM)
- 100 mL RFTM with antibiotics (this includes extra RFTM)
	- 5 mg nystatin
	- 500 mg chloramphenicol
	- 2 mL of pen/strap
	- 98 mL RFTM
- 100 mL PCM with antibiotics (this includes extra PCM)
	- 5 mg nystatin 
	- 500 mg chloramphenicol
	- 2 mL of pen/strap
	- 98 mL PCM

**Day 1**
1. Sterile dissection of the oyster tissue 
2. Cut mantle tissue in half and cut rectum tissue in half
3. Inoculate tissue samples into two tubes that will be used for iodine staining: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
4. Inoculate tissue samples into two tubes that will be used for culturing: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum tissue into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
5. Incubate two tubes for 48h at 27°C, leave two tubes to incubate for 7 days
**Day 3**
6. Take just tissue from RFTM and inoculate into 2 mL PCM with antibiotics in a tube 
7. Pipette up and down to disturb tissue, this is to dislodge cells 
8. Obtain four new tubes each containing 2 mL PCM with antibiotics, inoculate 0.5 mL of the original PCM with oyster tissue into each new tube
9. Make an extra fifth tube of PCM with antibiotics as a control 
10. Incubate these four new tubes and the fifth tube (the control) at 27°C (this may take 10-14 days)
**Day 7**
11. Take the remaining two tubes in the incubator out to stain with iodine 
**Day 13**
12. Take the PCM tubes out of the incubator now that 10 days have passed

11/11/2025 Tuesday 
- Obtained an oyster from Rowley in Wild tank 
- Sterile dissection of rectum and mantle tissue, cut each in half. There are now two rectum samples and two mantle samples, each sample is put into autoclaved 5 mL labeled tubes
- Weighed out antibiotics with the "more accurate" scale as seen in the above protocol (5 mg nystatin, 500 mg chloramphenicol, 2 mL of pen/strep) into a 100 mL screw cap bottle. 
- In the BSC, added 98 mL of RFTM into the 100 mL screw cap bottle to ensure the big bottle of RFTM remains sterile. 
- Added 2 mL of RFTM into labeled tubes with tissue
- Placed in lab incubator at 26.5°C rather than at 27°C

11/13/2025 Thursday 
- Make PCM with antibiotics by weighing out antibiotics with the "more accurate" scale (5 mg nystatin, 500 mg chloramphenicol, 2 mL of pen/strep), add to a 100 mL screw cap bottle, in BSC, add 98 mL of PCM
- In two 5 mL tubes, add 2 mL of PCM w antibiotics and inoculate rectum tissue into one, and mantle into the other, pipet up and down to dislodge tissue
- In nine 5 mL tubes (four for mantle and four for rectum), add 2 mL of PCM into each. Then inoculate 0.5 mL of the PCM containing dislodged tissue into eight of these tubes, one tube will be empty as a control
