- Perkinsus culturing media has been made and is in the fridge
- Two oysters will be used for the initial experiment, one rectum sample and one mantle sample will be taken from each oyster
11/4/2025
- One oyster from wild to homogenize 
- Three flasks will be made
	- One with rectum tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One with mantle tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One control with just PCM

From paper: Dungan, Reece 2006
1. Sterile dissection of the oyster tissue 
2. Inoculate the mantle and rectum tissue into its own 2 mL of RFTM tube with antibiotics
3. Incubate for 48h at 27°C
4. Take just tissue from RFTM and inoculate into 2 mL PCM with antibiotics in a tube 
5. Pipette up and down to disturb tissue, this is to dislodge cells 
6. Put 0.5 into a new tube with PCM and antibiotics, put 0.5 of PCM with antibiotics into a new 2 mL PCM
