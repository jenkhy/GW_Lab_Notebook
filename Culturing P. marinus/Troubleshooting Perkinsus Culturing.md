10/23/2025
- Perkinsus culturing media has been made and is in the fridge
- Two oysters will be used for the initial experiment, one rectum sample and one mantle sample will be taken from each oyster
11/4/2025
- One oyster from wild to homogenize 
- Three flasks will be made
	- One with rectum tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One with mantle tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One control with just PCM


[[Rough draft of Perkinsus Culturing protocol]] is used 

11/11/2025 Tuesday (Day 1)
- Obtained an oyster from Rowley in Wild tank 
- Sterile dissection of rectum and mantle tissue, cut each in half. There are now two rectum samples and two mantle samples, each sample is put into autoclaved 5 mL labeled tubes
- Weighed out antibiotics with the "more accurate" scale as seen in the above protocol (5 mg nystatin, 500 mg chloramphenicol into a 100 mL screw cap bottle. 
- Thawed a 2 mL aliquot of pen/strep in a beaker of water on the hot plate, added the pen/strep to the 100 mL bottle 
- In the BSC (to ensure the main stock of RFTM remains sterile), added 98 mL of RFTM into the 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- Labeled contents in 100 mL screw cap bottle as "RFTM with antibiotics (chloramphenicol, nystatin, and pen/strep)"
- Added 2 mL of RFTM into labeled tubes with tissue
- Placed in lab incubator at 26.5°C rather than at 27°C, led lights turning on occasionally for algae (forgot about this at the time)

11/13/2025 Thursday (Day 3)
- Made PCM with antibiotics by weighing out antibiotics with the "more accurate" scale (5 mg nystatin, 500 mg chloramphenicol) and added to a 100 mL screw cap bottle
- Thawed a 2 mL aliquot of pen/strep in a beaker of water on the hot plate, and added 2 mL pen/strep to 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- In the BSC (to ensure the main stock of PCM remains sterile), added 98 mL of RFTM into the 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- Labeled contents in 100 mL screw cap bottle as "PCM with antibiotics (chloramphenicol, nystatin, and pen/strep)"
- Created an ethanol-flaming set-up on lab bench for a sterile transfer of RFTM-inoculated tissue into PCM with antibiotics
	- Labeled two empty 5 mL tubes, one labeled "M" for mantle and one labeled "R" for rectum, to do a sterile transfer of RFTM-inoculated tissue into
- In BSC, brought the two 5 mL tubes, now with the RFTM-inoculated tissue, added 2 mL of PCM w antibiotics into each. 
- Pipetted up and down to dislodge tissue and vortexed each tube. This is now PCM w/ dislodged tissue
- Labeled nine empty 5 mL tubes (four "M" for mantle, four "R" for rectum, and one "C" for control), added 2 mL of PCM into each. Then, inoculated 0.5 mL of the PCM w/ dislodged tissue into eight of these tubes into their respectively labeled tubes. 
- Placed in lab incubator at 26.5°C rather than at 27°C, led lights turning on occasionally for algae 

11/18/2025 Tuesday (Day 7)
- The two tubes of RFTM-inoculated tissue were taken out of the incubator after 7 days
- The mantle and rectum tissue were placed on labeled microscope slides, teased apart, stained with lugol's iodine, and looked at under a microscope
- No perkinsus marinus cells were found
