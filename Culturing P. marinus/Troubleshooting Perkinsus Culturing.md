## Fall 2025

10/23/2025
- Perkinsus culturing media has been made and is in the fridge
- Two oysters will be used for the initial experiment, one rectum sample and one mantle sample will be taken from each oyster
11/4/2025
- One oyster from wild to homogenize 
- Three flasks will be made
	- One with rectum tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One with mantle tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One control with just PCM
[[Rough draft of Perkinsus Culturing protocol]] is used 

11/11/2025 Tuesday (Day 1)
- Obtained an oyster from Rowley in Wild tank 
- Sterile dissection of rectum and mantle tissue, cut each in half. There are now two rectum samples and two mantle samples, each sample is put into autoclaved 5 mL labeled tubes
- Weighed out antibiotics with the "more accurate" scale as seen in the above protocol (5 mg nystatin, 500 mg chloramphenicol into a 100 mL screw cap bottle. 
- Thawed a 2 mL aliquot of pen/strep in a beaker of water on the hot plate, added the pen/strep to the 100 mL bottle 
- In the BSC (to ensure the main stock of RFTM remains sterile), added 98 mL of RFTM into the 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- Labeled contents in 100 mL screw cap bottle as "RFTM with antibiotics (chloramphenicol, nystatin, and pen/strep)"
- Added 2 mL of RFTM into labeled tubes with tissue
- Placed in lab incubator at 26.5°C rather than at 27°C, led lights turning on occasionally for algae (forgot about this at the time)

11/13/2025 Thursday (Day 3)
- Made PCM with antibiotics by weighing out antibiotics with the "more accurate" scale (5 mg nystatin, 500 mg chloramphenicol) and added to a 100 mL screw cap bottle
- Thawed a 2 mL aliquot of pen/strep in a beaker of water on the hot plate, and added 2 mL pen/strep to 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- In the BSC (to ensure the main stock of PCM remains sterile), added 98 mL of RFTM into the 100 mL screw cap bottle 
- Labeled contents in 100 mL screw cap bottle as "PCM with antibiotics (chloramphenicol, nystatin, and pen/strep)"
- Created an ethanol-flaming set-up on lab bench for a sterile transfer of RFTM-inoculated tissue into PCM with antibiotics
	- Labeled two empty 5 mL tubes, one labeled "M" for mantle and one labeled "R" for rectum, to do a sterile transfer of RFTM-inoculated tissue into
- In BSC, brought the two 5 mL tubes, now with the RFTM-inoculated tissue, added 2 mL of PCM w antibiotics into each. 
- Pipetted up and down to dislodge tissue and vortexed each tube. This is now PCM w/ dislodged tissue
- Labeled nine empty 5 mL tubes ("M1", "M2",... "M4" for mantle, "R1", "R2",... "R4" for rectum, and one "C" for control), added 2 mL of PCM into each. Then, inoculated 0.5 mL of the PCM w/ dislodged tissue into eight of these tubes into their respectively labeled tubes. 
- "M1" and "R1" contained the largest piece of tissue that was dislodged/vortexed
- Placed in lab incubator at 26.5°C rather than at 27°C, led lights turning on occasionally for algae 

11/18/2025 Tuesday (Day 7)
- The two tubes of RFTM-inoculated tissue were taken out of the incubator after 7 days
- The mantle and rectum tissue were placed on labeled microscope slides, teased apart, stained with lugol's iodine, and looked at under a microscope
- No perkinsus marinus cells were found

11/25/2025 (Day 14)
- PCM tubes were taken out of the incubator and homogenized for ten seconds each
- The same homogenizer probe was used for each of the tubes since contamination between samples was not a concern as all tissue samples were from the same oyster 
- After all tubes were homogenized, the homogenizer probe was rinsed in a DI bath for ten seconds, then in a soapy water bath for 10 seconds
- PCM from "M1" and "R1" were taken and put on microscope slides
- Potential perkinsus cells were seen, with lots of debris, many clusters, and many large non-round unknown cells were seen as well (potentially bacteria?)

**Microscope Observations of Rectum in PCM:**
![[IMG_8712.heic]]
Lots of debris, but potential Perkinsus cells

![[IMG_8713.heic]]
Potential cells (ignore air bubbles)

![[IMG_8715.jpg]]
Unsure what these circled in red are... they are not perfectly round so doubting that they are Perkinsus, so possibly contamination. 

![[IMG_8716.jpg]]
Also unsure what these are circled in red, but potential cells in the background

![[IMG_8717.jpg]]
Potential cell at top of red circle, unsure what the bottom of red circle may be since it is not perfectly round

![[IMG_8719.heic]]
Closest looking to potential cells, many of them 

![[IMG_8720.heic]]
A cluster of unknown cells is seen in the center, potential cells are also seen in the background as clear round circles

**Microscope observations of Mantle in PCM:**
![[IMG_8723.heic]]
Strangely shaped debris, but potential cells in background seen as clear small circles

![[IMG_8724.heic]]
Possible contamination...

![[IMG_8726.heic]]
More potential cells 

![[IMG_8727.jpg]]
If looking closely, there are clear growth of line-like cells, unsure what these are. 

12/4/2025 Day 23
- PCM tubes stayed in the incubator for nine days after day 14 
- Control tube (which should have been looked at on Day 14, but was not) contained debris and cells, which is a potential sign that algae ended up in the tubes 
- Future PCM tubes should be kept in an incubator that is not shared with algae
	Plan: 
- Homogenize a new, larger oyster that will be put in culture media 

12/5/2025
- Looked at PCM from fridge, w/o antibiotics, w/o being in incubator, under the microscope
	- Lots of debris, explains the debris seen in the incubated PCM tubes 

12/11/2025
Meeting with Jade: 
- NaOH is only used for dissolving tissue to make it easier to count Perkinsus cells (using iodine)
- I looked at the fresh PCM from fridge and lots of debris was seen in there, I think it is because of the graduated cylinder I used to measure the saltwater when making it
- Still need to do a control for the incubator, putting a tube of PCM without antibiotics into the incubator to see if anything grows

12/19/2025
- Discarded PCM tubes in the incubator by dumping into a beaker, swishing with bleach, and dumping in sink

- Next steps for January: 
	1. Attempt at homogenizing another larger oyster first thing next semester to use for inoculating into PCM 
	2. If cells are seen, troubleshoot passaging cells from tubes into culture flasks 
	3. Using Jose's Perkinsus strains as practice once we receive them

## Spring 2026
Tuesday 1/20/2026 (Day 1: Inoculating tissue into RFTM)
- Used the RFTM w/antibiotics stock that was made 11/11/2025
	- It was kept in the fridge and should have been covered in foil but was not
- Before storing the RFTM w/antibiotics again, it was covered in foil
- In the BSC, ~2 mL RFTM w/antibiotics was pipetted into 5 mL tubes: two labeled R, two labeled M
- Dissected the mantle and rectum from two wild oysters from Mudcreek (the two oysters were attached, one small oyster attached to the shell of the large oyster) 
- 2-3 pieces of dissected tissue from the two oysters were inoculated into labeled 5 mL tubes of RFTM w/antibiotics
	- Later, it was realized that the tissue in all tubes were not properly submerged
- The 5 mL tubes of tissue-inoculated-RFTM w/antibiotics were covered in foil before being placed into the incubator since LED lights are used for algae 

Thursday 1/22/2026 (Day 3: transferring tissue from RFTM to PCM)
- Used PCM w/antibiotics stock that was made 11/13/2025
	- It was extremely cloudy, possibly due to the settling of antibiotics
	- Became less cloudy after mixing 
- In BSC, pipetted 2 mL of PCM w/antibiotics into labeled tubes,  "M", "M1", "M2", "R", "R1", "R2", and and "C"
- Three tubes from Day 1 were taken out from incubator, one mantle in RFTM tube and two rectum in RFTM tubes
	- The tissue in both rectum RFTM tubes was not submerged in the RFTM. Rectum tissue was still used 
	- Some tissue in the mantle RFTM tubes was not submerged in the RFTM, but some tissue was submerged. Mantle tissue was still used. 
- RFTM from tubes were poured into a waste beaker
- Each type of tissue was transferred into its respective PCM tube, "M" or "R"
- Tissue in "M" and "R" PCM tubes were homogenized in fume hood
- Homogenized tissue in "M" and "R" PCM tubes were evenly split and added to "M1", "M2", "R1", and "R2"
- All PCM tubes "M", "M1", "M2", "R", "R1", "R2", and and "C" were covered in foil and placed in incubator 
- Incubator is at 27.4°C

[[Plan for arrival of Jose's Perkinsus strains]]

Thursday 1/29/2026
- Properly submerged the oyster mantle in RFTM tissue, will allow it to stay in RFTM properly for five days (check on Tuesday Feb 3)
- Took photos of empty microscope slide

Thursday Feb 5, 2026
- Checked temperature of incubator using thermometer (it is set to be at 27°C)
	- Thermometer reads 30°C
- Viewed RFTM mantle tube under the microscope
	- saw one potential Perkinsus cell
- Viewed PCM tubes under microscope 
	- Lots of debris from microscope slides and PCM seen in all slides 
	- Potential cell clusters from M2 slide 
	- To view only things in the PCM liquid, slight shakes help you see what stays stationary (is debris from the slide) and what moves (whats in the liquid)
