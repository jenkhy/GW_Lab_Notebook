- Perkinsus culturing media has been made and is in the fridge
- Two oysters will be used for the initial experiment, one rectum sample and one mantle sample will be taken from each oyster
11/4/2025
- One oyster from wild to homogenize 
- Three flasks will be made
	- One with rectum tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One with mantle tissue inoculated in PCM
	- One control with just PCM

From paper: Dungan, Reece 2006

Materials:
- One oyster 
- Sterile scissors 
- Autoclaved four 5 mL tubes (for RFTM)
- 12 mL RFTM with antibiotics (this is including extra RFTM)
	- 


**Day 1**
1. Sterile dissection of the oyster tissue 
2. Cut mantle tissue in half and cut rectum tissue in half
3. Inoculate into two tubes that will be used for iodine staining: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
4. Inoculate into two tubes that will be used for culturing: one set of mantle into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics, and one set of rectum tissue into one tube of 2 mL of RFTM with antibiotics
5. Incubate for 48h at 27°C
**Day 3**
6. Take just tissue from RFTM and inoculate into 2 mL PCM with antibiotics in a tube 
7. Pipette up and down to disturb tissue, this is to dislodge cells 
8. Obtain four new tubes each containing 2 mL PCM with antibiotics, inoculate 0.5 mL of the original PCM with oyster tissue into each new tube
9. Make an extra fifth tube of PCM with antibiotics as a control 
10. Incubate these four new tubes at 27°C (this may take 10-14 days)
