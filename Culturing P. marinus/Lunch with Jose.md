Notes to share with him about what we're doing: 
- Trying to culture Perkinsus from wild oysters
	- To see if theres a difference between wild strains and the cell line strains 
	- to see if theres different genetic strains

Questions about Perkinsus culturing
- What type of culture media do you use?
	- Can we compare the compositions of our culture medias? We use DMEM and F12 with...
- What was troubleshooting P. marinus culturing like for you?
- Have you had issues with excess debris or contamination with your Perkinsus culturing?
	- How do you filter the PCM? We filter using...
- What does culturing P. marinus look like for you in your lab? (be more specific)
	- What do your cells look like?
	- How fast do your cells grow?
	- How often do you passage cells?
	- Where do you obtain your Perkinsus cells?
	- Is there a maximum for what temperature you should incubate Perkinsus cells at? Would incubating at 30°C be okay?


Questions about him (looked at his profile on Bigelow website)
- Can you share more about how you made Perkinsus a genetically traceable system? Does this look like doing DNA sequencing of P. marinus and comparing it to the oyster's DNA sequencing?
- I saw on your profile, you are currently working on creating oyster cell lines. In what ways is culturing oyster cells different from culturing P. marinus cells?
