Questions about Perkinsus culturing
- What type of culture media do you use? (We are using DMEM and F12)
- What was troubleshooting P. marinus culturing like for you?
- Have you had issues with excess debris or contamination with your Perkinsus culturing?
- What does culturing P. marinus look like for you in your lab?

Questions about him (looked at his profile on Bigelow website)
- How are you working towards making P. marinus genetically traceable? Does this look like doing DNA sequencing of P. marinus and comparing it to the oyster's DNA sequencing?
- I saw on your profile, you are currently working on creating oyster cell lines. In what ways is culturing oyster cells different from culturing P. marinus cells?
