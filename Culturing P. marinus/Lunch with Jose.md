**Notes to share with him about what we're doing:** 
- Our media consists of DMEM and Ham's F12, L-glutamine, betaine, and glucose, all dissolved in 16 g/L saltwater made with Instant Ocean. We supply it with the antibiotics, nystatin, chloramphenicol, and pen/strep.
- We filter the media with 0.22 um filter paper 
- We take mantle and rectum tissue from a wild oyster and inoculate a portion of either tissue type into RFTM, and inoculate the other portion of either tissue type into PCM. Inoculating some of the tissue into RFTM will allow us to determine after seven days if that oyster contained Perkinsus. 
- We are trying to culture Perkinsus from wild oysters
	- To see if there's a difference between wild strains and the cell line strains 
	- to see if there's different genetic strains

**Questions about Perkinsus culturing**
- Can we compare the compositions of our culture media? We use DMEM and F12 with...
- Did you troubleshoot how often the cells are passaged? Is the initial maximum seeding density you tried the same as what it is now?
- How do you filter the PCM? We filter using 0.22 um filter paper
- Do you have issues with dirty microscope slides? 
- What does culturing P. marinus look like for you in your lab? (be more specific)
	- What do your cells look like?
	- How fast do your cells grow?
	- How often do you passage cells?
	- Where do you obtain your Perkinsus cells from? Do you buy them or are they taken from oysters?
	- Is there a maximum for what temperature you should incubate Perkinsus cells at? Would incubating at 30°C be okay?


**Questions about him (looked at his profile on Bigelow website)**
- Can you share more about how you made Perkinsus a genetically traceable system? Does this look like doing DNA sequencing of P. marinus and comparing it to the oyster's DNA sequencing?
- I saw on your profile, you are currently working on creating oyster cell lines. In what ways is culturing oyster cells different from culturing P. marinus cells?
