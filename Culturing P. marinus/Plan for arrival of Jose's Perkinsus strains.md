Immediately when receiving (Day 0): 
- Store the strains in -20C until it can be thawed and put in media 

Inoculating strains into media and incubating (Day 1):
- Thaw strains 
- Set aside ~50 uL of one of the strains to put on a microscope slide
	- Take photos and make observations of what the perkinsus looks like under the microscope before being put into our own media
-  Split each strain into two 25 cm^2 flask containing 10 mL of PCM 
- View the flasks under the microscope before placing in incubator, take photos and make observations
- Place flasks of PCM into 27°C incubator (covered in foil to avoid the algae LED light?) to incubate for 10-14 days

Check on the flasks whenever I am in the lab:
- View the flasks under the microscope, take photos, and make observations by comparing them to what flask looked like on Day 1
- Immediately place back in the incubator
