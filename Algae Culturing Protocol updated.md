#AlgaeSpecies 
- We currently have three species of algae:
	- *Tetraselmis chuii*
		- T. chuii is a type of flagellate algae 
		- T. chuii is the most aggressive and competitive of the three, it is likely that T. chuii will contaminate another species' carboy
		- T. chuii appear green and oval-shaped under the microscope 
		- T. chuii are 4 to 15 um in size in diameter
	- *Isochrysis galbana*
		- I. galbana is a type of flagellate algae
		- I. galbana appear yellow and circular shaped under the microscope
		- I. galbana are 2 to 6 um in size in diameter
	- *Chaetoceros spp.*
		- Chaetoceros is a type of diatom algae 
		- Chaetoceros appear as brown chains under the microscope 
		- Chaetoceros are <10 to 50 um in size 
- Optimum environment for algae 
	- Optimum environment for all algae
		- 16° C to 27° C; optimum temperature is 24° C
	- Optimum salinity for algae 
		- Diatoms (Chaetoceros)
			- 20-25 psu
			- Use 20 psu saltwater
		- Flagellates (Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis chuii)
			- 25-30 psu
			- Use 25 psu saltwater
	#Weekly/DailyTasks 
	-  All algae cultures in flasks and carboys must be swirled once a day to prevent self-shading and settling
	- Add saltwater + F/2 media to algae carboys three times a week
		- Autoclave approximately 3000 mL of saltwater 
		- When autoclaved saltwater is cooled the next day, add 3 mL of F/2 media under a sterile biosafety cabinet
		- Pour saltwater + F/2 media mixture into algae carboy
