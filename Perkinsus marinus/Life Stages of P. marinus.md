**The life stages of P. marinus**
1. Zoospore
	- Motile, has two flagella for it to move around in the water, enters the oyster
2. Trophozoite
	- Becomes motile now that is in the oyster's hemocytes, causes tissue damage
3. Prezoosporangium
	- Protects itself when the oyster dies (the oyster's hemocytes were its home) or when the environment becomes harsh by thickening its cell wall, accumulation of carbs and lipids
	- This stage is also what is seen when the perkinsus cells are in RFTM media
4. Zoosporangium
	- Can release zoospores that will enter more oysters
- Hypnospore
	- when the trophozoite is under stress, such as when it is inoculated in RFTM, it enlarges the cell as the cell membrane is strengthened and the vacuole enlarges
