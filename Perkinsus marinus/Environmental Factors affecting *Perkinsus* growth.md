**Environmental Factors affecting *Perkinsus* growth**
- High temperature and high salinity affect *Perkinsus* growth when the *Perkinsus* cells are in these two stages:
	- it enlarges the cells by increasing the development of hypnospore (when trophozoites are under stress, like RFTM, trophozoites will enlarge into hypnospores)
	- it enlarges the cells in the trophozoite stage, and increases the trophozoite's metabolic activities
- High salinity increases the infectivity of perkinsus within the oyster host not because of increased infections from the water column (In Sarah's study, the water was changed constantly ruling out that the high intensity of infection was due to reproduction within the oyster)

Season of Perkinsus
- Perkinsus is most prevalent during May through October
